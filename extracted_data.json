The company also plans to produce\ncommercial electric vehicles\nsuch as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services.\n[4]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nCanoo was founded in 2017 under the name\nEvelozcity\nby Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for\nDeutsche Bank\nas its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for\nBMW\nas a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company\nFaraday Future\nbefore leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became\nchief technology officer\n.\n[5]\nThe company received its primary funding from Chinese investor\nLi \"David\" Pak-Tam/Botan\nand German entrepreneur David Stern.\n[6]\n[7]\nIn April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of\nOpel\nas a senior executive.\n[8]\nIn March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo.\n[9]\nIn July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company.\n[10]\nCanoo Lifestyle Vehicles\n, all-electric\nminivans\nMain articles:\nCanoo LV\nand\nCanoo MPDV\nIn September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the\nCanoo Lifestyle Vehicle\n.\n[11]\nIn February 2020,\nHyundai Motor Group\n, the parent company of\nHyundai Motors\nand\nKia Motors\n, announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's\nStrategy 2025\nprogram which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020.\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\nIn July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure.\n[15]\n[16]\nIn July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program\nJay Leno's Garage\n.\n[17]\nIn September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the\nspecial-purpose acquisition company\nHennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the\nNASDAQ\nvalued at $2.4 billion.\n[18]\nThe expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.\n[19]\n[20]\nOn December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.\n[21]\nA few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its\nMPDV\n(Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.\n[22]\nIn mid-January 2021,\nThe Verge\nreported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with\nApple\nfor a potential role in its secretive\nTitan car project\n.\n[23]\n[24]\nIn May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.\n[25]\nIt was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.\n[26]\nIn December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,\n[27]\n[28]\ncompeting EV startup Harbinger Motors.\n[29]\nCorporate changes\n[\nedit\n]\nOn March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the\nCanoo Pickup Truck\n, an electric\npickup\nset to release in 2023.\n[30]\n[31]\nCanoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque.\n[30]\nThe company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity.\n[30]\nAfter the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.\n[31]\nIt was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.\n[32]\nOn April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman\nTony Aquila\nas CEO.\n[33]\nAlso in April 2021, the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\nlaunched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.\n[34]\nOn June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in\nPryor, Oklahoma\n(just outside\nTulsa\n) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.\n[35]\n[36]\nThe plant will be used to build \"pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023.\"\n[36]\nThe same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company\nVDL Nedcar\nwould start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.\n[37]\nLater in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.\n[38]\nOn November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to\nBentonville, Arkansas\nand establish a manufacturing plant there.\n[39]\nAs of December 2022\n[update]\nthe company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.\n[1]\n[40]\nIn January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an \"advanced industrialization facility\" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.\n[41]\nIn August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production.\nFollowing receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the\nMidAmerica Industrial Park\n(MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.\n[42]\nThis was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.\n[43]\nIn late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.\n[44]\nIn April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a\nUnited States Department of Defense\ncontract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.\n[45]\nThe Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by\nTerex\n.\n[46]\nFirm orders\n[\nedit\n]\nOn April 13, 2022,\nNASA\nselected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its\nArtemis program\n, with a total contract value of $147,855.\n[47]\n[48]\nIn July 2022,\nWalmart\nentered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.\n[49]\nUnder the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.\n[50]\nCanoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in\nGreater Los Angeles\n, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.\n[51]\n[52]\n[53]\nSome days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.\n[54]\n[55]\nKingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.\n[56]\nIn January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.\n[57]\n[58]\n[59]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\n\"Canoo Investor Relations\"\n.\ninvestors.canoo.com\n.

The Asia-Pacific region dominated the global EV market with a share of 50.97% in 2022.\nThe environmental impact of conventional gasoline vehicles and the rise in fuel prices have paved the way for alternative fuel vehicles in the market. Buyers are gradually getting inclined to use battery-powered or hybrid automobiles, which is anticipated to drive the EV market. In recent years, the demand for BEVs has increased considerably among consumers because these vehicles do not use traditional fuels, such as gasoline or diesel. The maintenance cost of EVs is also considerably less, which gives it an advantage over conventional fuel-based vehicles.\nAll models use one or more electric motors for propulsion. Electricity is the main energy source for EVs. There is no internal combustion engine installed in them. A sudden rise in the market’s CAGR can be attributed to the robust demand for\nalternative fuel vehicles\n. Fossil fuel-based vehicles are one of the main causes of air pollution across the world.

The growth of the Electric Vehicles (EV) market has been significant despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting supply chain bottlenecks. Despite these recent challenges and rising production costs as a result of increasing raw material prices, EV sales are still going up at a fast rate. If this continues, they are set to surpass the sales of conventionally propelled vehicles (i.e., vehicles with internal combustion engines) . Compared to 2020, sales of new electric vehicles more than doubled in 2021 with an increase of 108%. This brought EV sales to about 5% of global passenger car sales in 2021.\nChina conveniently topped the global sales charts in 2021 with more electric vehicles sold than the rest of the world combined and almost five times more than Germany, which was in second place. Factors responsible for the Chinese market’s exponential growth include, but are not limited to, the Chinese government’s electric vehicle subsidies, an increasing range of mini electric vehicles, and more affordable brands coming onto the market. Overall, Europe recorded an increase between 2020 and 2021, reaching about 66%, with the plug-in hybrid share of all electric vehicle sales being the biggest in the world. Driven by the availability of more models, as well as the market expansion and purchase incentives, the European market is expected to continue along this trend as countries within the EU\nadopt stricter CO2 emission standards and move toward zero-emissions vehicle mandates.\nRegardless of the tremendous growth in the Electric Vehicles market, it is only limited to a part of the world. As the race to full electrification continues, China , Europe, and the U.S. account for about 95% of the global electric vehicle sales, whereas the rest of the world seems to struggle with catching up. In addition to government subsidies just getting introduced or still being nonexistent, the top reasons cited for the slow progress experienced in those parts of the world include the lack of public charging infrastructure and the premium prices of electric vehicles in these regions.\nOverview\nUnit Sales\nUnits\nAnalyst Opinion\nRevenue\nPrice\nGlobal Comparison\nKey Market Indicators\nPlease wait\nContact\nGet in touch with us.

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for two-thirds of new electric car registrations and two-thirds of the stock in 2020. China, with 4.5 million electric cars, has the largest fleet, though in 2020 Europe had the largest annual increase to reach 3.2 million.\nOverall the global market for all types of cars was significantly affected by the economic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first part of 2020 saw new car registrations drop about\none-third\nfrom the preceding year. This was partially offset by stronger activity in the second-half, resulting in a 16% drop overall year-on-year. Notably, with conventional and overall new car registrations falling, global electric car sales share rose 70% to a record 4.6% in 2020.\nAbout 3 million new electric cars were registered in 2020. For the first time, Europe led with 1.4 million new registrations. China followed with 1.2 million registrations and the United States registered 295 000 new electric cars.\nNumerous factors\ncontributed to increased electric car registrations in 2020. Notably, electric cars are gradually becoming more competitive in some countries on a total cost of ownership basis.\nSeveral governments provided or extended fiscal incentives\nthat buffered electric car purchases from the downturn in car markets.\nEurope\nOverall Europe’s car market contracted 22% in 2020. Yet, new electric car registrations more than doubled to 1.4 million representing a sales share of 10%. In the large markets, Germany registered 395 000 new electric cars and France registered 185 000.  The United Kingdom more than doubled registrations to reach 176 000. Electric cars in Norway reached a record high sales share of 75%, up about one-third from 2019. Sales shares of electric cars exceeded 50% in Iceland, 30% in Sweden and reached 25% in the Netherlands.\nThis surge in electric car registrations in Europe despite the economic slump reflect two policy measures. First, 2020 was the target year for the\nEuropean Union’s CO\n2\nemissions standards\nthat limit the average carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) emissions per kilometre driven for new cars. Second, many European\ngovernments increased subsidy schemes\nfor EVs as part of stimulus packages to counter the effects of the pandemic.\nIn European countries, BEV registrations accounted for 54% of electric car registrations in 2020, continuing to exceed those of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, the BEV registration level doubled from the previous year while the PHEV level thripled. The share of BEVs was particularly high in the Netherlands (82% of all electric car registrations), Norway (73%), United Kingdom (62%) and France (60%).\nChina\nThe overall car market in China was impacted by the panademic less than other regions. Total new car registrations were down about 9%.\nRegistration of new electric cars was lower than the overall car market in the first-half of 2020. This trend reversed in the second-half as China constrained the panademic. The result was a sales share of 5.7%, up from 4.8% in 2019. BEVs were about 80% of new electric cars registered.\nKey policy actions muted the incentives for the electric car market in China. Purchase subsidies were initially due to expire at the end of 2020, but following signals that they would be phased out more gradually prior to the pandemic, by April 2020 and in the midst of the pandemic, they were instead cut by 10% and exended through 2022. Reflecting economic concerns related to the pandemic,\nseveral cities relaxed car licence policies\n, allowing for more internal combustion engines vehicles to be registered to support local car industries.\nUnited States\nThe US car market declined 23% in 2020, though electric car registrations fell less than the overall market. In 2020, 295 000 new electric cars were registered, of which about 78% were BEVs, down from 327 000 in 2019. Their sales share nudged up to 2%. Federal incentives decreased in 2020 due to the federal tax credits for Tesla and General Motors, which account for the majority of electric car registrations,\nreaching their limit\n.\nOther countries\nElectric car markets in other countries\nwere resilent in 2020. For example, in Canada the new car market shrunk 21% while new electric car registrations were broadly unchanged from the previous year at 51 000.\nNew Zealand is a notable exception. In spite of its strong pandemic response, it saw a decline of 22% in new electric car registrations in 2020, in line with a car market decline of 21%. The decline seems to be largely related to exceptionally low EV registrations in April 2020 when New Zealand was in lockdown.\nAnother exception is Japan, where the overall new car market contracted 11% from the 2019 level while electric car registrations declined 25% in 2020. The electric car market in Japan has fallen in absolute and relative terms every year since 2017, when it peaked at 54 000 registrations and a 1% sales share. In 2020, there were 29 000 registrations and a 0.6% sales share.\nConsumer spending on EVs continues to rise, while government support stabilises\nConsumer spending\nConsumers spent USD 120 billion on electric car purchases in 2020, a 50% increase from 2019, which breaks down to a 41% increase in sales and a 6% rise in average prices. The rise in average prices reflects that Europe, where prices are higher on average than in Asia, accounted for a bigger proportion of new electric car registrations. In 2020, the global average BEV price was around USD 40 000 and around USD 50 000 for a PHEV.\nGovernment spending\nGovernments across the world spent USD 14 billion on direct purchase incentives and tax deductions for electric cars in 2020, a 25% rise year-on-year. Despite this, the share of government incentives in total spending on EVs has been on a downward slide from roughly 20% in 2015 to 10% in 2020.\nAll the increase in government spending was in Europe, where many\ncountries responded to the pandemic\n-induced economic downturn with incentive schemes that boosted electric car sales. In China, government spending decreased as the eligibility requirements for incentive programmes tightened.\nAn important novelty in subsidy schemes was the\nintroduction of price caps in Europe\nand China\n, i.e. no subsidy given for vehicles with prices above a certain threshold. This might be responsible for average electric car price falling in Europe and China: BEV cars sold in China were 3% cheaper in 2020 than in 2019, while PHEV cars in Europe were 8% cheaper.\nConsumer and government spending on electric cars, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nMore electric car models are available; ranges start to plateau\nElectric car models available globally and average range, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nElectric car models available by region, 2020\nOpen\nexpand\nAutomakers entice customers with a wide menu including electric SUV models\nWorldwide about 370 electric car models were available in 2020, a 40% increase from 2019. China has the widest offering, reflecting its  less consolidated automotive sector and that it is the world’s largest EV market. But in 2020 the biggest increase in number of models was in Europe where it  more than doubled.\nBEV models are offered in most vehicle segments in all regions; PHEVs are skewed towards larger vehicle segments. Sport utility vehicle (SUV) models account for half of the available electric car models in all markets. China has nearly twice as many electric car models available as the European Union, which has more than twice as many electric models as the United States. This difference can partially be explained by the comparatively lower maturity of the US EV market, reflecting its weaker regulations and incentives at the national level.\nThe average driving range of new BEVs has been steadily increasing. In 2020, the weighted average range for a new battery electric car was about 350 kilometres (km), up from 200 km in 2015.The weighted average range of electric cars in the United States tends to be higher than in China because of a bigger share of small urban electric cars in China.The average electric range of PHEVs has remained relatively constant about 50 km over the past few years.\nThe widest variety of models and the biggest expansion in 2020 was in the SUV segment. More than 55% of announced models worldwide are SUVs and pick-ups. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) may be moving to electrify this segment for the following reasons:\nSUVs are the fastest growing market segment in Europe and China, and by far the largest market share in the United States.\nSUVs command higher prices and generally offer higher profit margins than smaller vehicles. This means OEMs find it easier to bear the extra costs of electrification for SUVs since the powertrain accounts for a smaller share of the total cost compared with a small car.\nElectrifying the heaviest and most fuel consuming vehicles\ngoes further toward meeting emissions targets than electrifying a small car.\nIn Europe,\nthe ZLEV credit scheme in the most recent CO\n2\nemissions standards\noffers strong incentives for selling electric SUVs from 2025, as it relaxes emissions standards in proportion to their potential to reduce specific CO\n2\nemissions. In fact, in Europe, the share of electric SUV models is higher than for the overall market.\nChina leads in electric LCV sales with Europe not far behind and Korea entering the market\nGlobal electric light-commercial vehicle (LCV) stock numbers about 435 000 units. About a third of these are in Europe where new electric LCV registrations in 2020 were only 5% below those in China, which is the world leader.\nElectric LCV registrations in China in 2020 were 3 400 units below the previous year and slightly less than half of the peak in 2018. The bulk of the electric LCV registrations are BEVs, with PHEVs accounting for less than 10%.\nIn Europe, electric LCV registrations jumped almost 40% in 2020 from the prior year to exceed 37 000 units. Though that was less impressive than the more than doubling of electric car registrations. New EV registrations in Europe are being driven by economic stimulus packages and by\nCO\n2\nstandards\nthat limit emissions per kilometre driven. However, current standards for LCVs are not stringent enough to warrant large-scale electrification, as they do for passenger cars.\nRegistration of electric LCVs in 2020 in the rest of the world were about 19 000 units. Most of these were in Korea, reflecting the launch of two new BEV LCV models, but Canada also added to the stock of electric LCVs. Other markets around the world have yet to see much uptake of electric LCVs.\nThe explosion of home deliveries during the Covid-19 pandemic further boosted the electric LCV expansion in some countries. Increased deliveries raised concerns about\nair pollution\n, particularly in urban areas. In response, a number of companies announced\nplans to electrify delivery fleets\n.\nElectric LCVs registrations by region, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\n18 of the 20 largest OEMs have committed to increase the offer and sales of EVs\nOriginal equipment manufacturer announcements related to electric light-duty vehicles\nOpen\nexpand\nOriginal equipment manufacturer announcements related to electric light-duty vehicles\nClose dialog\nDownload image\nDownload image\nSources\nBMW (2021); BJEV-BAIC (2021); BYD (2021); Chery (2021); Changan Automobile (2021); Daimler (2021); Dongfeng (2021); FAW (2021); Ford (2021); GAC; General Motors; Honda (2021); Hyundai (2020); Mazda (2021); Renault-Nissan (2019); Maruti Suzuki (2019); SAIC (2021); Stellantis (2021); Toyota (2021); Volkswagen (2021).\nNotes\nThis table is based on the authors’ understanding of OEM announcements and may not be complete. It includes only announcements related to electric\nlight-duty vehicles (PHEVs and BEVs) and it excludes announcements related to hybrid vehicles and those that do not provide a clear indication of the EV share.\nManufacturers’ electrification targets align with the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario\nOEMs are expected to embrace electric mobility more widely in the 2020s. Notably 18 of the 20 largest OEMs (in terms of vehicles sold in 2020), which combined accounted for almost 90% of all worldwide new car registrations in 2020, have announced intentions to increase the number of available models and boost production of electric light-duty vehicles (LDVs).\nA number of manufacturers have raised the bar to go beyond\nprevious announcements\nrelated to EVs with an outlook beyond 2025. More than ten of the largest OEMs worldwide have declared electrification targets for 2030 and beyond.\nSignificantly, some OEMs plan to reconfigure their product lines to produce only electric vehicles. In the first-trimester of 2021 these announcements included:\nVolvo will only sell electric cars from 2030\n;\nFord will only electric car sales in Europe from 2030\n;\nGeneral Motors plans to offer only electric LDVs by 2035\n;\nVolkswagen aims for 70% electric car sales in Europe, and 50% in China and the United States by 2030\n;\nand Stellantis aims for 70% electric cars sales in Europe and 35% in the United States\n.\nOverall, the announcements by the OEMs translate to estimated cumulative sales of electric LDVs of 55-72 million by 2025. In the short term (2021-2022), the estimated cumulative sales align closely with the electric LDV\nprojections in the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario\n. By 2025, the estimated cumulative sales based on the OEMs announcements are aligned with the trajectories of IEA Sustainable Development Scenario.\nOEMs’ announcements compared to electric LDVs stock projections, 2021-2025\nOpen\nexpand\nTrends and developments in electric heavy-duty vehicles\nElectric bus and truck registrations expanded in major markets in 2020\nElectric bus and electric heavy-duty truck (HDT) registrations increased in 2020 in China, Europe and North America. The global electric bus stock was 600 000 in 2020 and the electric HDT stock was 31 000.\nBus registrations\nChina continues to dominate the\nelectric bus market\n, with registration of 78 000 new vehicles in 2020, up 9% on the year to reach a sales share of 27%. Local policies to curb air pollution are the driving force.\nElectric bus registrations in Europe were 2 100, an increase of around 7%, well below the doubling in registrations seen in 2019. Electric buses now make up 4% of all new bus registrations in Europe. It is too early to see the effect of the non-binding\nEuropean Clean Bus Deployment Initiative\nand demand may be still largely driven by muncipal level policies.\nIn North America, there were 580 new electric bus registrations in 2020, down almost 15% from the prior year. In the United States, electric bus deployment primarly reflects polices in California, which is the location of most of the current e-bus stock. In South America, Chile leads the way registering 400 electric buses in 2020 for a total stock of more than 800. India increased electric bus registrations 34% to 600 in 2020.\nHeavy-duty truck registrations\nGlobal electric HDT registrations were 7 400 in 2020, up 10% on the previous year. The global stock of electric HDTs numbers 31 000. China continues to dominate the category, with 6 700 new registrations in 2020, up 10% though much lower than the fourfold increase in 2019. Electric HDT registrations in Europe rose 23% to about 450 vehicles and in the United States increased to 240 vehicles. Electric trucks are still below 1% of sales in both.\nElectric\ntruck registrations by region, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nElectric bus registrations by region, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nElectric heavy-duty vehicle models are broadening\nThe availability of electric heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) models is expanding in leading global markets.\n1\nBuses were the earliest and most successful case of electrification in the HDV market, but the growing demand for electric trucks is pushing manufacturers to broaden product lines. Nevertheless, model availability is not the only indicator of a healthy market – fewer total models may reflect the reliability and broad applicability of existing designs, whereas more diversity of models may reflect the need to tailor products for specific needs and operations.\nThe growth in electric model availability from 2020 to 2023 across segments – bus, medium freight truck (MFT), heavy freight truck (HFT) and others – demonstrates manufacturers’ commitments to electrification. Truck makers such as\nDaimler\n,\nMAN\n,\nRenault\n,\nScania\nand\nVolvo\nhave indicated they see an all-electric future. The broadening range of available zero-emission HDVs, particularly in the HFT segment, demonstrates the commitment to provide fleets the flexibility to meet operational needs.\nThe HDV segment includes a wide variety of vehicle types, e.g. from long-haul freight to garbage collection trucks. China has the most variety in available electric bus models. The availablity of MFT models is broadest in the United States. For HFTs – the segment where the EV model offer is expected to the grow the most – Europe offers the widest selection of models.\nNumber of electric HDVs models available by segment and year, 2020-2023\nOpen\nexpand\nTypes of zero-emission HDVs expand, and driving range lengthens\nCurrent And Announced Zero Emission HDV Models By Segment, Release Year And Powertrain In Major Markets, 2020-2023\nOpen\nexpand\nCurrent And Announced Zero Emission HDV Models By Segment, Release Year And Powertrain In Major Markets, 2020-2023\nClose dialog\nDownload image\nDownload image\nSources\nIEA analysis based on the Global Drive to Zero ZETI tool.\nNotes\nData are derived from CALSTART’s Zero-Emission Technology Inventory.

This equates to 4.8 million vehicles switched to EVs and chargers installed in 6 500 locations by 2030.\nCollectively, by 2020 EV100 members had already deployed 169 000 zero-emission vehicles, double the previous year. Even though companies identify commercial vans and heavy-duty vehicles as the most difficult EVs to find, the number of commercial electric vehicles rose 23% in 2020, including a threefold increase in electric trucks.\nEV100 members are also expanding the availability of charging infrastructure for staff and customers, with 16 900 charging points installed at 2 100 locations worldwide. Over half of EV100 members are using renewables to power all their charging operations.\nSignificant barriers to EV adoption remain. EV100 members reported the lack of charging infrastructure as the top barrier (especially in the United States and United Kingdom). Lack of availability of appropriate vehicle types was also highlighted by the companies as a persistant obstacle. The purchase price of EVs remains an important hurdle despite many companies acknowledge the significant cost savings over the lifetime of a vehicle due to lower fuel and maintenance costs.\nTo help overcome these barriers, 71% of EV100 members support more favourable EV procurement tax benefits and 70% favour more supportive policies at state, regional and city government levels. Sixty percent of the member companies support government targets to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles.\nTop 5 barriers to EV adoption reported by EV100 member companies\nOpen\nexpand\nBattery demand lagged EV sales in 2020; Europe sees highest rise in demand\nAutomotive lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery production was 160 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2020, up 33% from 2019. The increase reflects a 41% increase in electric car registrations and a constant average battery capacity of 55 kilowatt-hours (kWh) for BEVs and 14 kWh for PHEVs. Battery demand for other transport modes increased 10%. Battery production continues to be dominated by China, which accounts for over 70% of global battery cell production capacity.\nChina accounted for the largest share of battery demand at almost 80 GWh in 2020, while Europe had the largest percentage increase at 110% to reach 52 GWh. Demand in the United States was stable at 19 GWh.\nNickel-manganese-cobalt continues to be the dominant chemistry for Li-ion batteries, with around 71% sales share and nickel-cobalt-aluminium accounting for most of the rest. Lithium-iron-phosphate battery chemistry has regained sales share but is still under 4% for the electric car market.\nAccording to the\nBNEF’s yearly survey of battery prices,\nthe weighted average cost of automotive batteries declined 13% in 2020 from 2019, reaching USD 137/kWh at a pack level. Lower prices are offered for high volume purchases, confirmed by\nteardown analysis\nof a VW ID3 showing an estimated cost of USD 100/kWh for its battery cells.\nIn Europe, demand for batteries in 2020 exceeded domestic production capacity. Today Europe’s main battery factories are located in Poland and Hungary. Production capacity is roughly 35 GWh per year, but\nannounced capacity could yield up to 400 GWh by 2025\n. Momentum was evident in 2020 in Europe with many new battery plants announced or under construction with support from the\nEuropean Investment Bank\n. In the United States, both Korean and domestic battery manufacturers have signalled large\ninvestments\nin a market currently dominated by a Tesla-Panasonic joint venture.\nBattery demand by region, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nBattery demand by mode, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nPandemic spreads popularity of electric micromobility\nElectric micromobility surged in the second-half of 2020, one of the consumer trends that accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic, further boosted by the construction of bike lanes and other measures to promote mobility.\nSales of private e-bikes in the United States more than doubled\nin 2020, outpacing sales of all bikes which were up an already healthy 65%.\nMany shared micromobility operators reduced or\nsuspended services\nduring the height of the second-quarter 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns. But as confinements were eased, services rebounded strongly, with\n270 cities worldwide relaunching operations\n. As of February 2021, around 650 cities have shared micromobility services. In Europe, e-scooter services have increased rapidly, with more than 100 cities adding operations since July 2020.\nPreliminary data from operators indicate\naverage trip distances on e-scooters have increased\nby around 25% relative to\nbefore the pandemic\n. Operators are increasingly offering more powerful e-bikes with plans to\nexpand into electric mopeds\n, which could further displace longer trips currently completed by car or public transit.\nSeveral major operators are introducing swappable batteries to improve operational efficiency and reduce emissions. Although the use of\nswappable batteries\nincreases the number of total batteries needed to support a fleet, it can significantly reduce operational emissions and enable longer lifetime of vehicles.\nPrivately owned electric two/three-wheelers (which include motorised vehicles such as motorcycles and mopeds but exclude micromobility solutions) are concentrated in Asia, with China accounting for 99% of registrations. The global stock of electric two/three-wheelers is now around 290 million. Electric two/three-wheelers account for one-third of all two/three-wheeler sales. While current sales are dominated by Asia, the market is growing rapidly in Europe, rising by 30% in 2020, benefitting from wider model availability and continued incentives.\nAvailability of dockless shared micromobility services in Europe and Central Asia, 2019-2021\nOpen\nexpand\nKorea takes a lead in deploying fuel cell electric vehicles\nFuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are zero-emission vehicles that convert hydrogen stored on-board using a fuel cell to power an electric motor. FCEV cars became commercially available in 2014, though registrations remain three orders of magnitude lower than EVs as hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) are not widely available and unlike EVs cannot be charged at home. Few commercial FCEV models are available and with high fuel cost and purchase prices result in a higher total cost of ownership than EVs.\nTo address the chicken-and-egg problem for FCEVs a number of goverments have funded the construction of HRS and have deployed public buses and trucks, such as garbage trucks, to provide a certain level of station utilisation. Today, there are approximately 540 HRS globally that provide fuel for almost 35 000 FCEVs. Approximately three-quarters of the FCEVs are LDVs, 15% are buses and 10% are trucks.\nIn 2020, Korea took the lead in FCEVs, surpassing the United States and China, to reach more than 10 000 vehicles. To support these FCEVs, the number of HRS in Korea increased by 50%, with 18 new stations in 2020. FCEVs in China are almost exclusively buses and trucks, unlike most other countries where cars are dominant. China accounts for 94% of global fuel cell buses and 99% of fuel cell trucks.\nIn 2020, the global FCEV stock increased 40%, with Korea contributing half and doubling its total FCEV stock. Japan and China increased the number of HRS, each opening about 25 stations in 2020. Worldwide the number of HRS increased 15%.\nFuel cell vehicles and hydrogen refueling station stock by region, 2020\nOpen\nexpand\nFuel cell electric vehicles stock by region and by mode, 2020\nOpen\nexpand\nDeployment of vehicle-charging infrastructure\nPublicly accessible slow and fast chargers increased to 1.3 million in 2020\nStock of slow public electric light duty vehicles chargers, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nStock of fast public electric light duty vehicles chargers, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nInstallation of publicly accessible chargers expanded sevenfold in the last five years; Covid-19 muted the pace in 2020 while China still leads\nWhile most charging of EVs is done at home and work, roll-out of publicly accessible charging will be critical as countries leading in EV deployment enter a stage where simpler and improved autonomy will be demanded by EV owners. Publicly accessible chargers reached 1.3 million units in 2020, of which 30% are fast chargers. Installation of publicly accessible chargers was up 45%, a slower pace than the 85% in 2019, likely because work was interrupted in key markets due to the pandemic. China leads the world in availability of both slow and fast publicly accessible chargers.\nSlow chargers\nThe pace of slow charger (charging power below 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 65% to about 500 000 publicly accessible slow chargers. This represents more than half of the world’s stock of slow chargers.\nEurope is second with around 250 000 slow chargers, with installtions increasing one-third in 2020. The Netherlands leads in Europe with more than 63 000 slow chargers. Sweden, Finland and Iceland doubled their stock of slow chargers in 2020.\nInstallation of slow chargers in the United States increased 28% in 2020 from the prior year to total 82 000. The number of slow chargers installed in Korea rose 45% in 2020 to 54 000, putting it in second place.\nFast chargers\nThe pace of fast charger (charging power more than 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 44% to almost 310 000 fast chargers, slower than the 93% pace of annual growth in 2019. The relatively high number of publically available fast chargers in China is to compensate for a paucity of private charging options and to facilitate achievement of goals for rapid EV deployment.\nIn Europe, fast chargers are being rolled out at a higher rate than slow ones. There are now more than 38 000 public fast chargers, up 55% in 2020, including nearly 7 500 in Germany, 6 200 in the United Kingdom, 4 000 in France and 2 000 in the Netherlands. The United States counts 17 000 fast chargers, of which nearly 60% are Tesla superchargers. Korea has 9 800 fast chargers.\nPublicly accessible fast chargers facilitate longer journeys. As they are increasingly deployed, they will enable longer trips and encourage late adopters without access to private charging to purchase an electric vehicle.\nMost countries in Europe did not achieve 2020 AFID targets for publicly accessible chargers\nEuropean countries for the most part failed to meet the recommended electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) per EV 2020 targets for publicly accessible chargers set by the\nAlternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive\n(AFID). However, there are wide disparities between countries.\nAFID, the key policy regulating the deployment of public electric EVSE in the European Union, recommended that member states aim for 1 public charger per 10 EVs, a ratio of 0.1 in 2020.\nIn the European Union, the average public EVSE per EV ratio was 0.09 at the end of 2020. But that is not the whole story. The Netherlands and Italy are above the target at 0.22 and 0.13 respectively, with almost all being slow chargers, though fast chargers are 3% of the installations in the Netherlands and 9% in Italy.\nCountries with the highest EV penetration tend to have the lowest EVSE per EV ratios, such as Norway (0.03), Iceland (0.03) and Denmark (0.05). In these sparsely populated countries with many detached houses and private parking spaces, most EV owners can\nlargely use private home charging\n. To a lesser extent, it also refects that the Nordic countries have a higher proportion of fast chargers, with shares of 40% in Iceland, 31% in Norway and 17% in Denmark.\nRatio of public chargers per EV stock by country, 2020\nOpen\nexpand\nPlanning needs to start now for megachargers to enable long-distance trucking\nThe roll-out of public charging infrastructure has so far mostly focused on serving electric light-duty vehicles. The electrification of heavy freight trucks (HFTs) is a longer term endeavour, with less than 40 electric HFTs on the road in 2020.\nHFTs require batteries with high capacity to meet their needs for heavy-duty cycles and long-range operations, and consequently they require high power charging. So far charging options for HFTs have tended to be early stage demonstrations, proof-of-concept activities and efforts to faciliate\nstandardisation\n.\nMegachargers of 1 megawatt (MW) or more would be capable of charging trucks operating over long distances reasonably quickly. Long-term planning for megacharger infastructure is needed now to avoid negative impacts on the electrical grid. Some impact to grids is inevitable given the\nhigh power requirements\nof megachargers. Significant investment may be needed for grid reinforcements, modernisation, storage and integration with power systems. Planning and co-ordination among electricity generators, distribution system operators and megacharging operations are needed.\nSome efforts are underway to develop standards for megachargers. Working jointly, the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council have developed an\nultra-high power charging standard\n(up to 900 kW), called ChaoJi. A version up to 1.8 MW, called Ultra ChaoJi, is under development. In parallel, the CharIN initiative\nestablished a task force\ncalled the Megawatt Charging System Taskforce which aims to develop a new high power standard above 1 MW by 2023 for charging heavy-duty trucks, based on the\ncombined charging system (CCS) standard\n. Prototype testing started in\nSeptember 2020\n. Tesla\nannounced in late 2020\nthat it is working with third-parties to develop a standard for megachargers that can be provided to Semi truck owners. Tesla is one of five to have submitted a design to CharIN.\nIndustry experts addressing international standardisation are evaluating avenues to harmonise megacharger standards for mutual compatibility, in order to facilitate the roll-out of electric HFTs.\nThere are also regional efforts to develop megacharging infrastructure. Underpinned with\nstimulus funding\n, Iberdrola, a Spanish multinational electric utility, has expressed interest in installing megacharger infrastructure in heavy-duty freight truck corridors in Spain by 2025. ElaadNL (EV knowledge centre of Dutch grid operators), along with local and national government entities, in September 2021 launched an\nopen-access test centre for companies and academia\nthat offers test facilities for megachargers. In the United States, the\nWest Coast Clean Transit Corridor Initiative\naims to install charging sites capable of charging HDTs at 2 MW along key transit corridors from Mexico to the boder with Canada by 2030.\nReferences\nElectric HDVs data are derived from the Global Drive to Zero’s\nZero Emission Technology Inventory\n(ZETI) which is a regularly updated tool that offers a detailed glimpse of announced OEM production model timelines.

The year 2026 has emerged as a tipping point for an acceleration in EV adoption that will drive automotive electrification trends ahead. By 2030 over one in four new passenger cars sold will be an electric vehicle. Many major vehicle manufacturers worldwide have signaled the end of an era of internal combustion engines (ICE) as the transition to zero emission vehicles (ZEV) is ramped up.\nThe top automakers are expected to account for more than 70% of global EV production by the year 2030 (compared to 2022 when they represented only 10% of all EV manufacturers). But despite the rapidly growing choices EV consumers have, and the unprecedented loyalty rates among EV return buyers, the industry as a whole still needs to tackle consumers range anxiety, particular for those without a garage or those traveling long distances.\nThe solution needs to be a joint effort between multiple industries: automotive, utilities, government, and private property owners such as shopping malls and apartment complexes. As these paths converge, vehicle electrification trends will increase exponentially. And we may, indeed, see the end of the ICE-age.\nTalk to a S&P Global Mobility representative about our powertrain and sustainable mobility solutions\nLEARN MORE >\nHow many vehicles sold last month?\nS&P Global Mobility provides near real-time updates of electrified (BEV and hybrid) light vehicle sales volumes for 150+ countries by brand, model and fuel type.

With advancements in technology, increasing environmental consciousness, and supportive government policies, EVs have gained significant traction as a viable and sustainable transportation option. As concerns over climate change and air pollution intensify, consumers and industries are increasingly turning to electric vehicles to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a greener future. This growing global momentum has propelled the EV market into a transformative phase, with innovations and investments driving the expansion of EV adoption across the world.\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study,\nRequest for Free Sample Report\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study,\ndownload the pdf brochure\nElectric Vehicle Market Growth Dynamics:\nDriver: Reducing prices of EV batteries will increase demand for EVs by making them cost effective\nDue to technological advancements and the production of\nEV batteries\non a mass scale in large volumes, the cost of EV batteries has been decreasing during the past decade. This has led to a decrease in the cost of electric vehicles as EV batteries are one of the most expensive components of an electric vehicle. The prices of EV batteries fell significantly in the last decade, from USD 1,200/kWh in 2010 to USD 160/kWh in 2023 and is expected to decrease in the coming years. Meanwhile the price is as low as USD 100 per kWh in China. This is because of the reducing manufacturing costs of these batteries, reduced cathode material prices, higher production, etc. The prices of EV batteries are expected to fall to approximately USD 60 per kWh by 2030, which is expected to significantly reduce the prices of EVs, making them cheaper than conventional ICE vehicles. The price of EV batteries is expected to reach around USD 80 per kWh by 2025. This will bring the price of EVs to the same level as that of ICE vehicles in the market and start a big shift to EVs. From 2025, we can expect EVs to get cheaper than some ICE vehicles. The improvement in battery technology is the main reason for this fall in battery prices. Once Solid-State Batteries enter the EV market, we can expect another price fall (per kWh) by the end of this decade.\nRestraint: High initial investments for installing EV fast charging infrastructure\nThe initial investment in setting up a fast-charging system is significantly higher compared to petrol, CNG, or LPG fuel stations. This has been a major restraint for countries around the world in adopting EVs on a higher scale during the past decade. Technological enhancements are expected to negate this restraint, leading to decreasing costs. The cost for EV fast charging is high due to the higher equipment costs and the requirement for an additional fast charger to install a transformer to connect the grid and charging system. This has led to the slower development of charging networks around the world which have gained traction during the past few years due to vehicle emission concerns.  The high initial investment required for EV infrastructure is one of the key factors influencing EV sales. Setting up a comprehensive and efficient EV charging station can incur significant costs. For instance, in India, a single DC fast charger setup could cost more than USD 12,193, and if multiple chargers are installed, the initial investment could easily go up to USD 48,772, taking into account the cost/rent of the land. The type of chargers installed also impacts the investment, with different charger types having varying costs.  In APAC region for instance prices vary by charger type and have additional costs. These include additional expenses such as that for obtaining a new electricity connection, civil works, EVSE management software and integration (approximately USD 9,145), and technicians, manpower, and maintenance (around USD 4,267 yearly). Advertising and promotion costs (about USD 609) and land lease expenses (around USD 7,316 yearly if the land is leased) further add to the total. Consequently, the total approximate cost for the first year, including setup and leased land, could reach USD 487,72. Subsequent operational costs, starting from the second year, amount to USD 12,193 annually, including land lease expenses. Operational costs include software maintenance, technical maintenance, and manpower expenses, all contributing to the significant investment required for establishing and running an EV charging station. These high initial and operational costs create barriers for businesses and individuals looking to invest in EV infrastructure, which in turn can impact the growth and adoption of EVs in the market. Nevertheless, as the demand for EVs rises and technology improves, we can expect to see potential reductions in these costs over time.\nOpportunity: Rising demand for electric vehicles in the automotive and transportation sectors\nIncrease in the adoption and demand for electric vehicles has accentuated the need to develop charging infrastructure and the EV market. Leading markets for electric vehicles such as China, US, and Germany are investing significantly in electric vehicles and EV charging infrastructure along with research & development for faster and efficient charging methods, longer range EVs, and lower cost batteries. Significant investments by automakers are expected to cater to the rising demand for EVs. Countries across North America and Europe along with many Asian countries have adopted measures to reduce emissions during the coming decades and replace their vehicle fleets for lower emissions by varying numbers by 2035. This is expected to lead to a significantly high demand for electric vehicles. OEMs offer a wide range of vehicles, from small hatchbacks such as Leaf to high-end sedans such as Tesla model 3. The wide range of product offerings has attracted a high number of consumers, resulting in an increased market for electric vehicles. For instance, in January 2018, Ford announced plans to increase planned investments to USD 11 billion by end of 2022 for the development of EVs. The company introduced 40 EVs in 2022, of which 16 are expected to be fully electric and 24 are expected to be plug-in hybrid vehicles. The investment is higher than the previously announced target of USD 4.5 billion. Further, Stellantis also plans to come with 29 new EVs by 2030. Launched in September 2020, SAIC-GM-Wuling has a range of 106 miles on a single charge and was one of the highest selling EVs in 2021 and 2022.\nChallenge: High cost of electric vehicles (compared to ICE)\nThe high manufacturing cost of EVs has been a major concern in their widespread adoption. The expected reduction in battery prices and reduced R&D costs are expected to lead to the reduction in the overall cost of purchasing electric hatchbacks, crossovers, or SUVs to reach the levels of ICE vehicles, leading to the rising demand for EVs. The cost of EVs is significantly high compared to that of ICE vehicles due to the high price of rechargeable lithium ion batteries required for these vehicles. The price of the cathode affects the price of the batteries to a high extent. This is because materials such as cobalt, nickel, lithium, and magnesium used in these batteries is high-priced. The cost of the production of EVs is also significantly high compared to ICE vehicles due to the expensive process involved in developing these vehicles. The cost of the development of higher range EVs is significantly higher due to the requirement of higher specification batteries, advanced technology used for production, and highly expensive components used in the vehicles.\nMarket Ecosystem\nFCEVs to be the fastest growing segment during forecast period\nThe FCEV uses fuel cells to generate electricity for powering the vehicle. Fuel cells in a vehicle generate electricity from the oxygen in the air and compressed hydrogen. FCEVs are completely emission-free as they emit water or heat. FCEVs have been introduced in the US, majorly in California. Many renowned truck manufacturers have already developed fuel-cell electric trucks. For instance, in September 2022, Toyota Motor Corporation (Japan) and Kenworth (US) designed heavy-duty Class 8 FCEVs. Similarly, in January 2023, Adani Group (India) signed an agreement with Ashok Leyland (India) and Ballard Power (Canada) to launch a pilot project for a hydrogen fuel cell electric truck in India Japan and Europe are focusing on the launch of FCEVs. Top FCEVs on the road that are commercially available include Hyundai Tucson FCEV, Toyota Mirai, Hyundai Nexo, and Honda Clarity. Fuel cell vehicles have higher fuel economy and can travel approximately 300–400 miles with a full fuel tank. The best FCEVs can have a range of more than 500 miles on a single filling. The refueling time for fuel cell-powered vehicles is approximately three to five minutes. This makes FCEVs an ideal option for transportation on definite or fixed routes. However, the availability of infrastructure such as hydrogen refueling stations and hydrogen production facilities supporting fuel cell technology is very limited worldwide due to the high cost of the fuel cell stack and system. Hydrogen is also difficult to store and transport which adds to the cost of the system. However, governments of various regions are increasingly investing in the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure. For instance, in November 2022, the Government of Alberta in Canada announced an investment of USD 300 million from the Strategic Innovation Fund's Net Zero Accelerator initiative, along with a provincial contribution of USD 161.5 million, to back a substantial USD 1.6 billion project led by Air Products Canada Ltd. The project aims to drive the advancement of clean fuels and clean energy in Canada while creating numerous middle-class job opportunities. The funding will specifically support the construction of a hydrogen production and liquefaction facility in Edmonton. The facility will utilize auto thermal reforming and carbon capture technology, further emphasizing the commitment to sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions.\nMid-priced EV segment to be the largest market during the forecast period\nA mid-priced vehicle is considered to have a price of USD 30,000 to USD 45,000. This vehicle class has limited features with low emphasis on features such as infotainment, instrument cluster, and other expensive features. China is one of the leading markets for the mid-priced segment. Established automotive manufactures such as Hyundai, General Motors, Honda, and Nissan are also manufacturing mid-priced EVs to acquire higher market shares. Some other mid-priced EVs include BMW 3 Series PHEV, Zeekr One, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Volvo XC40, Renault Megane EV, Hyundai  Ioniq 5, Volkswagen  ID 4, Kia  Niro EV, etc. In 2022, BYD Song Pro/Plus was the best selling mid-priced EV in Asia Pacific region, followed by Tesla Model 3 in Europe and North America. The EV Market forecast for the mid-priced segment is the largest in the Asia Pacific and European regions due to the demand for low-emission vehicles at reasonable prices. Various top EV models such as Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe, Mitsubishi Outlander, Volkswagen Passat, Hyundai Kona, etc. fall under this category. These were also some of the largest selling EVs in these regions excluding Tesla in 2022. Thus, the demand for mid-priced EVs has been high in the past few years and is expected to keep rising in the coming decade.

The governments of these emerging economies have recognized the growth potential of the EV Market trends and, hence, have taken different initiatives to attract major OEMs to manufacture electric vehicles in domestic markets. The region is home to 93 of the world’s most polluted cities, and has a high energy demand. As of 2022, transportation sector in the region accounts for around 14% of overall emissions. Thus, countries in the region, are planning to reduce emissions in the coming years. China, the e-mobility leader in the region, had set a target of over 20% EV sales by 2025, which it had already achieved in 2022 and is expected to have around 35% in 2023. Similarly, countries such as South Korea, Japan and India have also announced plans to shift to EVs in coming years. India for instance, plans to have 30% of its passenger car sales to be electric by 2030. South Korea and Japan are also aiming to be among the world’s top 5 EV producers by 2030. China is also investing significantly in the production of both electric passenger as well as commercial vehicles, with plans for export. OEMs such as BYD plan to open plants in other parts of the world to manufacture electric buses and electric trucks to meet regional demand. The country supports EV usage by offering a subsidy for buying EVs. The country is also encouraging manufacturers to develop better EV technology. Various EV charging stations are set up across the country due to the subsidy for setting up EV infrastructure. The country has promoted the development and use of EV buses and trucks. In 2020, a low-cost EV passenger car, Wulin Hongguang Mini EV, was developed in China, costing less than USD 5,000. The vehicle sold majorly in the domestic market, but its gross sales were the second highest of the total EV sales in 2022. The demand of Mini-EVs has been growing in the country, with more choices available with other leading Chinese manufacturers entering the mini-EV space. Luxury EVs have also increased in demand in the country, with major domestic OEMs in China have grabbed the EV Market share. According to various official estimates, the market share is expected to be around 35% of the total vehicle market in 2023.\nKey Market Players\nThe electric vehicle market is dominated by BYD (China), Tesla (US), Volkswagen AG (Germany), SAIC Motors (China), and Stellantis (Netherlands), among others.

DISCUSSION GUIDE\n19.3 KNOWLEDGESTORE: MARKETSANDMARKETS’  SUBSCRIPTION PORTAL\n19.4 CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS\n19.5 RELATED REPORTS\n19.6 AUTHOR DETAILS\nThe study involved four major activities in estimating the current size of the electric vehicle market. Exhaustive secondary research was done to collect information on the market, the peer market, and the child markets. The next step was to validate these findings, assumptions, and sizing with the industry experts across value chains through primary research. The top-down and bottom-up approaches were employed to estimate the complete market size. Thereafter, market breakdown and data triangulation processes were used to estimate the market size of segments and subsegments.\nSecondary Research\nIn the secondary research process, various secondary sources such as company annual reports/presentations, press releases, industry association publications [for example, publications of electric vehicle manufacturers, International Energy Agency (IEA), Alternative Fuel Data Center (AFDC), European Alternate Fuels Observatory (EAFO), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Regional Transportation Authority (RTA), country-level vehicle associations and trade organizations, and the US Department of Transportation (DOT)], EV related magazine articles, directories, technical handbooks, World Economic Outlook, trade websites, government organizations websites, and technical articles have been used to identify and collect information useful for an extensive commercial study of the global EV Market.\nPrimary Research\nExtensive primary research has been conducted after acquiring an understanding of this market scenario through secondary research. Several primary interviews have been conducted with market experts from the demand- and supply-side OEMs (in terms of component supply, country-level government associations, and trade associations) and component manufacturers across four major regions, namely, Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, Middle East & Africa. Approximately 23% and 77% of primary interviews have been conducted from the demand and supply side, respectively. Primary data has been collected through questionnaires, emails, LinkedIn, and telephonic interviews. In the canvassing of primaries, we have strived to cover various departments within organizations, such as sales, operations, and administration, to provide a holistic viewpoint in our electric vehicle market report.\nAfter interacting with industry experts, we conducted brief sessions with highly experienced independent consultants to reinforce the findings from our primaries. This, along with the in-house subject matter experts’ opinions, has led us to the findings as described in the remainder of this report. Following is the breakdown of primary respondents.\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study,\ndownload the pdf brochure\nMarket Size Estimation\nThe bottom-up approach was used to estimate and validate the total market size. This method was also used extensively to estimate the size of various subsegments in the market. The research methodology used to estimate the market size includes the following:\nThe key players in the industry and markets have been identified through extensive secondary research\nThe industry’s supply chain and market size, in terms of volume, have been determined through primary and secondary research processes\nAll percentage shares, splits, and breakdowns have been determined using secondary sources and verified through primary sources\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study,\nRequest for Free Sample Report\nMarket Size Validation\nThe top-down approach has been used to estimate and validate the size of the electric vehicle market by drive type and top speed in terms of volume.\nThe top-down approach has been used to estimate and validate the size of the EV Market. In this approach, key drive and top speeds of electric vehicles are identified for each propulsion type (BEV, PHEV, and FCEV) at the country-level. The penetration of each identified drive type and top speed type for each propulsion type is multiplied with the volume of each vehicle at the country-level to derive the total volume. All country-level data is summed up to derive the global market by drive and top speed type.\nData Triangulation\nAfter arriving at the overall market size—using the market size estimation processes as explained above—the market was split into several segments and subsegments. To complete the overall market engineering process and arrive at the exact statistics of each market segment and subsegment, data triangulation, and market breakdown procedures were employed, wherever applicable.

(“Canoo”), a company developing breakthrough electric vehicles (EV) from the ground up, and Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV (“HCAC”) (NASDAQ: HCAC), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination that would result in Canoo becoming a publicly listed company. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined operating company will be named Canoo Inc. and will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol “CNOO.”\nCanoo is a high-growth EV company, distinguished by its experienced team with an emphasis on engineering expertise and achievement. Canoo has designed the world’s flattest modular “skateboard” platform that allows it to reimagine EV design, maximize usable interior space and support a wide range of vehicle applications. Canoo’s skateboard architecture – a unique, self-contained, independently drivable rolling chassis – directly houses all of the most critical components of an EV. It will feature the market’s first true steer-by-wire platform, which, along with a composite leaf spring suspension, enables the skateboard’s flat structure and maximizes vehicle interior space. Canoo has also developed proprietary electric drivetrain and battery systems which are incorporated into the skateboard. All of Canoo’s EVs will share the same skateboard and utilize different cabins or “top hats” that can be paired on top to create unique vehicles. This highly modular approach will facilitate efficient production at scale and enable Canoo to rapidly develop vehicles serving different market and consumer segments at reduced cost, as the majority of research and development and crash testing is built into the skateboard.\nCanoo Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Ulrich Kranz said, “Today marks an important milestone of Canoo’s effort to reinvent the development, production and go-to-market model of the electric vehicle industry. Our technology allows for rapid and cost-effective vehicle development through the world’s flattest skateboard architecture, and we believe our subscription model will transform the consumer ownership experience. We are excited to partner with Hennessy Capital and we are energized to begin our journey through a shared passion to deliver an environmentally friendly and versatile vehicle development platform to the market.”\nDaniel Hennessy, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of HCAC said, “We are thrilled to partner with Canoo on their mission to reinvent urban mobility with a greener, simpler and more affordable portfolio of EV solutions. Unlike any other EV company, Canoo has created a go-to-market strategy that captures both B2C and B2B demand with the same skateboard architecture and technology that has already been validated by key partnerships such as with Hyundai. HCAC has an abiding commitment to sustainable technologies and infrastructure, and we are excited to serve as a catalyst to advance the launch of the Canoo vehicle offerings.”\nLed by Kranz, an automotive industry veteran with more than 30 years of executive experience at BMW, together with nearly 300 employees, the Canoo team has already shown its ability to deliver results by successfully designing, engineering and manufacturing its Beta vehicle in just 19 months and has completed more than 50 physical crash tests. Canoo expects to introduce its first model in 2022 that will be targeted at consumers in major urban markets. This lifestyle vehicle – eponymously named the canoo – leverages the company’s low profile skateboard architecture to deliver the highest volume utilization across all classes of competitor vehicles currently on the market and has been purposefully developed for a subscription business model.\nIn addition, Canoo has designed a commercial delivery B2B vehicle with expected availability in 2023 that directly capitalizes on Canoo’s core skateboard technology. Canoo’s delivery vehicle competes in a size segment that other competitors are currently not addressing and capitalizes on the need for a small, city- built, last-mile delivery solution. This high-efficiency platform maximizes cubic cargo volume and targets the fast growing last-mile delivery market.\nCanoo’s consumer go-to-market strategy capitalizes on changing consumer preferences to deliver a month-to-month, commitment-free, subscription-based business model. With a single monthly fee and no upfront payment, Canoo members enjoy the benefits of an all-inclusive experience that, in addition to your own canoo vehicle, includes maintenance, warranty, registration and access to insurance and vehicle charging. This go-to-market model is designed to deliver an affordable and simplified customer experience while also enhancing lifetime vehicle revenue and margin to shareholders.\nTo learn more about Canoo and for a video of the company’s vehicle, please\nclick here\n.\nTransaction Overview\nThe business combination values Canoo at an implied $2.4 billion pro forma equity value, at the $10.00 per share price and assuming no redemptions of HCAC’s existing public stockholders. The combined company will receive approximately $600 million of proceeds from an upsized fully committed common stock PIPE offering of over $300 million, along with the approximately $300 million cash held in trust assuming no redemptions of HCAC’s existing public stockholders. The boards of directors of both Canoo and HCAC have unanimously approved the proposed business combination, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020, subject to, among other things, the approval by HCAC stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions.\nAdditional information about the proposed transaction, including a copy of the merger agreement and investor presentation, will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by HCAC today with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at\nwww.sec.gov\n.\nAdvisors\nBofA Securities is serving as exclusive financial advisor, and Cooley LLP is serving as legal advisor to Canoo. Nomura Securities International, Inc. and Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated are serving as joint placement agents on the PIPE offering and as joint financial advisors to HCAC, and Sidley Austin LLP is serving as legal advisor to HCAC. ICR, LLC is serving as communications advisor for Canoo.\nInvestor Conference Call\nCanoo and HCAC will host a joint investor conference call to discuss the business and the proposed transaction today, August 18, 2020 at 8:00 AM ET.\nTo listen to the conference call via telephone dial (833) 529-0219 (U.S.) and (236) 389-2148 (international callers/U.S. toll) and enter the conference ID number 8571848.

Distinguished by its experienced team – numbering nearly 300 employees from leading tech and automotive companies – Canoo has designed a modular skateboard platform purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. Canoo expects to launch its first consumer model in 2022, simply named the canoo and available only by subscription, followed shortly after by a last-mile delivery vehicle and a sport vehicle, each built off of the same underlying skateboard platform.\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.canoo.com\n.\nFor Canoo press materials, including photos, please visit\npress.canoo.com\n.\nAbout HCAC\nHennessy Capital Acquisition Corp.

Forward- looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target” or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters.

These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo’s and HCAC’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo and HCAC.

Starting today, the lifestyle vehicle, MPDV and pickup truck can be reserved in the United States, with a $100 deposit per vehicle at\nwww.canoo.com/reservations\n. The Lifestyle Vehicle will be the first vehicle to market in 2022, and has targeted pricing starting from $34,750 -$49,950\ni\nfor Delivery, Base and Premium models, before incentives, or optional equipment. Deliveries for the Pickup Truck and scaled production for MPDV are scheduled to begin as early as 2023.\n\"It's no longer a question of whether America will go EV – but when. Our line-up is future-forward and succeeds where others have struggled: Giving people the EV that works smarter for them at a price that can work for their budgets. That's why we are designing for flexible use cases and focused on productivity solutions,\" said Tony Aquila, Chairman & CEO Canoo Inc. \"We are designing for people who work hard, play hard and need something reliable, that will last and give you value. We're for the 99% not the 1%. Our vehicle line-up is built for the backbone of America – to give you value so you can work smarter.\"\nLifestyle Vehicle – The Flex-Vehicle for Everybody\nCanoo designed the Lifestyle Vehicle to be cabin forward to maximize interior space and function, with exportable power and customization options – all on a small footprint. Now available in four trims: Base, Premium, Adventure and Delivery – the Lifestyle Vehicle is the ultimate multi-tasker. Without the need for an engine compartment, the Lifestyle Vehicle features Canoo's unique street view window for improved driver visibility. Our Adventure trim has more ground clearance and a more muscular profile. The bumpers have been enhanced and a metal skid plate was added for increased vehicle durability. And Canoo's signature headlights and taillights serve as core brand identifiers without the need for a logo.\nLike all Canoo vehicles, the Lifestyle Vehicle is a purpose-built EV based on the company's proprietary and highly versatile multi-purpose platform architecture. The Lifestyle Vehicle has the interior space of a large SUV, with the exterior footprint of a compact car and is made for urban, adventure, families, fleet, ride hailing and more.\nAnticipated specifications include up to 300hp and 332 lb.-ft. of peak motor torque with 250 miles of battery range.

Range topping Adventure trim pricing will be announced in the coming months.\nThe Pickup Truck - Ready for Work & Weekend\nCanoo's fully electric pickup truck is all-American and ready for work and the weekend. Featuring a cabin-forward design, steer-by-wire technology and proprietary multi-purpose platform architecture, the pickup truck has an extendable flatbed that competes with America's best-selling pickup trucks on a smaller footprint—making it easier to maneuver and more convenient to drive. The pickup truck was built to work for users and features accessories that accommodate on-site jobs, including exportable power, advanced exterior lighting, fold down worktable and cargo storage, flip-down side-tables, sidestep and storage, extendable bed with space dividers and multi-accessory charge port.\nSpecifications include dual or rear motor configurations, with 500+hp and 550 lb.-ft. of torque with dual motors, vehicle payload capacity of 1800 lbs. and 200+ miles of battery range.\nThe Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle (MPDV) - Small Business, Fleet & Family Friendly\nOur delivery vehicle is designed to maximize return on investment for a wide range of commercial customers. It was built with small businesses, fleets and last-mile delivery companies in mind. High efficiency and class leading cargo volumes offer cost savings which allow businesses to reinvest and thrive – making this delivery vehicle a great option for independent contractors, tradespeople, utilities, service technicians and more.\nBi-directional onboard charging maximizes functionality and transforms the vehicle into a power plant for equipment and tools that can be powered up even at remote destinations. The vehicle design also accommodates workstations to store and access a variety of devices, products and equipment.\nDepending on the configuration, anticipated specifications include up to 200hp and 236 lb.-ft. of peak motor torque with up to 250 miles of battery range.\n* Targeted price ranges reflect current estimates and are subject to change. Anticipated vehicle specifications and performance metrics are prospective, reflecting current engineering and design direction, manufacturer simulations and EPA-estimated average range calculation methodology.

Read\nInnovation\nCopy link to clipboard\nBENTONVILLE, Ark., July 12, 2022\n— Walmart (NYSE: WMT) has signed a definitive agreement with Canoo (NASDAQ: GOEV), a high-tech advanced mobility company, to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (LDV), with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. The vehicles will be used to deliver online orders in a sustainable way which will also contribute to Walmart’s goal to achieve zero-emissions by 2040. While the LDV is expected to begin hitting the road in 2023, the companies plan to kick off advanced deliveries to refine and finalize vehicle configuration in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in the coming weeks.\nThe LDV: Engineered for sustainable last mile deliveries with improved driver ergonomics and safety\nCanoo’s fully electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (LDV) is an all-American commercial EV optimized for sustainable last mile delivery use cases. As with all Canoo vehicles, the LDV is built on a proprietary multi-purpose platform (MPP) architecture that integrates the motors, battery module and other critical driving components. The LDV has a last mile delivery optimized cabin and customized cargo space. Canoo is utilizing true steer by wire technology, reducing moving parts and cabin intrusion, resulting in more usable interior space, better driver ergonomics and the addition of a panoramic window to improve road visibility.\nThe LDV is engineered for high frequency stop-and-go deliveries and speedy vehicle to door drop-off, including grocery and food/meal delivery. Its customized interior is designed for small package delivery, at competitive per stop economics. The modular design and 120 cubic feet cargo volume are adaptable to evolve with customer needs which contributes to a decreasing per unit investment over time.\n“We are proud to have been selected by Walmart, one of the most sophisticated buyers in the world, to provide our high-tech, all-electric, American made Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle to add to their impressive logistics capabilities. Our LDV has the turning radius of a small passenger vehicle on a parking friendly, compact footprint, yet the payload and cargo space of a commercial delivery vehicle. This is the winning algorithm to seriously compete in the last mile delivery race, globally,” said Tony Aquila, investor, chairman and CEO of Canoo. “Walmart’s massive store footprint provides a strategic advantage in today’s growing ‘Need it now’ mindset and an unmatched opportunity for growing EV demand, especially at today’s gas prices.”\nExpanding Walmart’s last mile delivery fleet\nCanoo’s electric vehicles will be driven by Walmart associates and used to deliver online orders, from groceries to general merchandise, as well as the potential to be used for\nWalmart GoLocal,\nthe retailer’s delivery-as-a-service business.\n“We’re thrilled to continue diversifying our last mile delivery fleet with Canoo’s unique and sustainably focused all-electric technology which will provide our associates with safe, ergonomic delivery vehicles,” said David Guggina, senior vice president of innovation and automation, Walmart U.S. “Today, the closest Walmart to customers is right in their pockets – it’s the Walmart app. By continuing to expand our last mile delivery fleet in a sustainable way, we’re able to provide customers and Walmart+ members with even more access to same-day deliveries while keeping costs low.”\nIn addition to dedicated fulfillment centers, Walmart uses 3,800 of its stores, which are located within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population, to fulfill online orders. The retailer does this using a combination of Walmart associates, independent contractors driving on the Spark Driver Network, third-party delivery service providers, and in some locations, autonomous vehicles and drones, to make deliveries. Through their expansive last mile delivery network, Walmart can reach 80% of the U.S. population with same-day delivery on a growing assortment of items.\nCollaborating close to home\nCanoo’s agreement with Walmart builds on the company’s existing commitments in the state of Arkansas. Last year Canoo announced it had selected Bentonville, Arkansas, as its headquarters and Pryor, Oklahoma, as the site for its U.S. manufacturing, further establishing an EV ecosystem in the heartland to create thousands of technology and manufacturing jobs in the surrounding communities.\n“We’re encouraged that by being located in close proximity to the Canoo headquarters, we have the advantage to collaborate and innovate in real-time as well as the opportunity to aid in the creation of manufacturing and technology jobs here in our home state of Arkansas,” added Guggina.\nCanoo anticipates starting production of the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles beginning in Q4, 2022.\nAbout Walmart\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) helps people around the world save money and live better — anytime and anywhere — in retail stores, online, and through their mobile devices.

The growth in electric car sales took place in the context of globally contracting car markets: total car sales in 2022 dipped by 3% relative to 2021. Electric car sales – including battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) – exceeded 10 million last year, up 55% relative to 2021.\n2\nThis figure – 10 million EV sales worldwide – exceeds the total number of cars sold across the entire European Union (about 9.5 million vehicles) and is nearly half of the total number of cars sold in China in 2022. In the course of just five years, from 2017 to 2022, EV sales jumped from around 1 million to more than 10 million. It previously took five years from 2012 to 2017 for EV sales to grow from 100 000 to 1 million, underscoring the exponential nature of EV sales growth. The share of electric cars in total car sales jumped from 9% in 2021 to 14% in 2022, more than 10 times their share in 2017.\nOver 26 million electric cars were on the road in 2022, up 60% relative to 2021 and more than 5 times the stock in 2018\nIncreasing sales pushed the total number of electric cars on the world’s roads to 26 million, up 60% relative to 2021, with BEVs accounting for over 70% of total annual growth, as in previous years. As a result, about 70% of the global stock of electric cars in 2022 were BEVs. The increase in sales from 2021 to 2022 was just as high as from 2020 to 2021 in absolute terms – up 3.5 million – but relative growth was lower (sales doubled from 2020 to 2021). The exceptional boom in 2021 may be explained by EV markets catching up in the wake of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Seen in comparison to recent years, the annual growth rate for electric car sales in 2022 was similar to the average rate over 2015-2018, and the annual growth rate for the global stock of electric cars in 2022 was similar to that of 2021 and over the 2015-2018 period, showing a robust recovery of EV market expansion to pre-pandemic pace.\nGlobal electric car stock, 2010-2022\nOpen\nexpand\nHalf of the world’s electric cars are in China\nThe increase in electric car sales varied across regions and powertrains, but remains dominated by the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”). In 2022, BEV sales in China increased by 60% relative to 2021 to reach 4.4 million, and PHEV sales nearly tripled to 1.5 million. The faster growth in PHEV sales relative to BEVs warrants further examination in the coming years, as PHEV sales still remain lower overall and could be catching up on the post-Covid-19 boom only now; BEV sales in China tripled from 2020 to 2021 after moderate growth over 2018-2020. Electric car sales increased even while total car sales dipped by 3% in 2022 relative to 2021.\nChina accounted for nearly 60% of all new electric car registrations globally. For the first time in 2022, China accounted for more than 50% of all the electric cars on the world’s roads, a total of 13.8 million. This strong growth results from more than a decade of sustained policy support for early adopters, including an\nextension of purchase incentives\ninitially planned for phase-out in 2020 to the end of 2022 due to Covid-19, in addition to non-financial support such as rapid roll-out of charging infrastructure and stringent registration policies for non-electric cars.\nIn 2022, the share of electric cars in total domestic car sales reached 29% in China, up from 16% in 2021 and under 6% between 2018 and 2020. China has therefore\nachieved\nits 2025 national target of a 20% sales share for so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs)\n3\nwell in advance. All indicators point to further growth: although the national NEV sales target is yet to be updated by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), which is responsible for the automotive industry, the objective of greater road transport electrification is re-affirmed in multiple strategy documents. China aims to reach a\n50%\nsales share by 2030 in so-called “key air pollution control regions”, and\n40%\nacross the country by 2030 to support the national action plan for carbon peaking. If recent market trends continue, China’s 2030 targets may also be reached ahead of time. Provincial governments are also supporting adoption of NEVs, with 18 provinces to date having set NEV targets.\nSupport at the regional level in China has also helped to advance some of the world’s largest EV makers. Shenzhen-based BYD has supplied most of the city’s electric buses and taxis, and its leading position is also reflected in Shenzhen’s ambition of reaching a\n60%\nNEV sales share by 2025. Guangzhou, which has a 50% NEV sales share by 2025 target,\nfacilitated\nthe expansion of Xpeng Motors to become one of the national EV frontrunners.\nMonthly new electric car registrations in China, 2020-2023\nOpen\nexpand\nWhether China’s electric car sales share will remain significantly above the 20% target in 2023 remains uncertain, as sales may have been especially high in anticipation of incentives being phased out at the end of 2022. Sales in January 2023\nplunged\n, and while this is in part due to the timing of the Chinese New Year, they were nearly 10% lower than sales in January 2022. However, electric car sales caught up in February and March 2023, standing nearly 60% above sales in February 2022 and more than 25% above sales in March 2022, thereby bringing sales in the first quarter of 2023 more than 20% higher than in the first quarter of 2022.\nGrowth remained steady in Europe despite disruptions\nIn Europe,\n4\nelectric car sales increased by more than 15% in 2022 relative to 2021 to reach 2.7 million. Sales grew more quickly in previous years: annual growth stood at more than 65% in 2021 and averaged 40% over 2017-2019. In 2022, BEV sales rose by 30% relative to 2021 (compared to 65% growth in 2021 relative to 2020) while PHEV sales dipped by around 3%. Europe accounted for 10% of global growth in new electric car sales. Despite slower growth in 2022, electric car sales are still increasing in Europe in the context of continued contraction in car markets: total car sales in Europe dipped by 3% in 2022 relative to 2021.\nThe\nslowdown\nseen in Europe relative to previous years was, in part, a reflection of the exceptional growth in electric car sales that took place in 2020 and 2021 in the European Union, as manufacturers quickly adjusted corporate strategy to comply with the CO\n2\nemission\nstandards\npassed in 2019. These standards covered the 2020-2024 period, with EU-wide emission targets becoming stricter only from 2025 and 2030 onwards.\nHigh energy prices in 2022 had a mixed impact on the competitiveness of EVs relative to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Gasoline and diesel prices for ICE cars spiked, but residential electricity tariffs (with relevance for charging) also increased in some cases. Higher electricity and gas prices also increased manufacturing costs for both ICE and EV cars, with some carmakers arguing that high energy prices could\nrestrict\nfuture investment for new battery manufacturing capacity.\nEurope remained the world’s second largest market for electric cars after China in 2022, accounting for 25% of all electric car sales and 30% of the global stock. The sales share of electric cars reached 21%, up from 18% in 2021, 10% in 2020 and under 3% prior to 2019. European countries continued to rank highly for the sales share of electric cars, led by Norway at 88%, Sweden at 54%, the Netherlands at 35%, Germany at 31%, the United Kingdom at 23% and France at 21% in 2022. In volume terms, Germany is the biggest market in Europe with sales of 830 000 in 2022, followed by the United Kingdom with 370 000 and France with 330 000. Sales also exceeded 80 000 in Spain. The share of electric cars in total car sales has increased tenfold in Germany since before the Covid-19 pandemic, which can in part be explained by increasing support post-pandemic, such as purchase incentives through the\nUmweltbonus\n, and a frontloading of sales in 2022 in\nexpectation\nof subsidies being further reduced from 2023 onwards. However, in Italy, electric car sales decreased from 140 000 in 2021 to 115 000 in 2022, and they also decreased or stagnated in Austria, Denmark and Finland.\nElectric car registrations and sales share in selected European countries, 2018-2022\nOpen\nexpand\nElectric car registrations and sales share in China, United States and Europe, 2018-2022\nOpen\nexpand\nElectric car registrations and sales share in selected countries, 2018-2022\nOpen\nexpand\nSales are expected to continue increasing in Europe, especially following\nrecent policy\ndevelopments under the ‘Fit for 55’ package. New rules set stricter CO\n2\nemission standards for 2030-2034 and target a 100% reduction in CO\n2\nemissions for new cars and vans from 2035 relative to 2021 levels. In the nearer term, an incentive mechanism operating between 2025 and 2029 will reward manufacturers that achieve a 25% car sales share of zero- and low-emission cars (17% for vans). In the first two months of 2023, battery electric car sales were already\nup\nby over 30% year-on-year, while overall car sales increased by just over 10% year-on-year.\nThe United States confirms return to growth\nIn the United States, electric car sales increased 55% in 2022 relative to 2021, led by BEVs. Sales of BEVs increased by 70%, reaching nearly 800 000 and confirming a second consecutive year of strong growth after the 2019-2020 dip. Sales of PHEVs also grew, albeit by only 15%. The increase in electric car sales was particularly high in the United States, considering that total car sales dropped by 8% in 2022 relative to 2021, a much sharper decrease than the global average (minus 3%). Overall, the United States accounted for 10% of the global growth in sales. The total stock of electric cars reached 3 million, up 40% relative to 2021 and accounting for 10% of the global total. The share of electric cars in total car sales reached nearly 8%, up from just above 5% in 2021 and around 2% between 2018 and 2020.\nA number of factors are helping to increase sales in the United States. A greater number of available models, beyond those offered by Tesla, the historic leader, helped to close the\nsupply\ngap. Given that major companies like Tesla and General Motors had already reached their subsidy cap under US support in previous years,\n5\nnew models from other companies being available means that more consumers can benefit from purchase incentives, which can be as high as USD 7 500. Awareness is increasing as government and companies lean towards electrification: in 2022, a quarter of Americans expect that their next car will be electric,\naccording\nto the American Automobile Association. Although charging infrastructure and driving range have improved over the years, they remain major\nconcerns\nfor US drivers given the typically long travel distances and lower popularity and limited availability of alternatives such as rail. However, in 2021 the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law strengthened support for EV charging, allocating USD 5 billion in total funding over the 2022-2026 period through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, as well as USD 2.5 billion in competitive grants over the same period through the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program.\nMonthly new electric car registrations in the United States, 2020-2023\nOpen\nexpand\nThe acceleration in sales growth could continue in 2023 and beyond thanks to recent new\npolicy\nsupport (see\nProspects for electric vehicle deployment\n). The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has triggered a\nrush by global electromobility companies\nto expand US manufacturing operations. Between August 2022 and March 2023, major EV and battery makers announced cumulative post-IRA investments of\nUSD 52 billion\nin North American EV supply chains, of which 50% is for battery manufacturing, and about 20% each for battery components and EV manufacturing. Overall, company announcements including tentative commitments for US investments for future battery and EV production add up to around\nUSD 75-108 billion\n. As an example, Tesla plans to\nrelocate\nits Berlin-based lithium-ion battery gigafactory to Texas, where it will work in\npartnership\nwith China’s CATL, and to manufacture next-generation EVs\nin Mexico\n. Ford also announced a\ndeal with CATL\nfor a battery plant in Michigan, and\nplans\nto increase electric car manufacturing sixfold by the end of 2023 relative to 2022, at 600 000 vehicles per year, scaling up to 2 million by 2026. BMW is seeking to\nexpand\nEV manufacturing at its plant in South Carolina following the IRA. Volkswagen chose Canada for its\nfirst battery plant outside Europe\n, which will begin operations in 2027, and is also investing USD 2 billion in its plant in South Carolina. While these investments can be expected to lead to high growth in the years to come, the impact may only fully be seen from 2024 onwards as plants come online.\nIn the immediate term, the IRA has\nconstrained\neligibility requirements for purchase incentives, as vehicles need to be produced in North America in order to qualify for a subsidy. However, electric car sales have remained strong since August 2022, and the first months of 2023 have been no exception: In the first quarter of 2023, electric car sales increased 60% compared to the same period in 2022, potentially boosted by the January 2023 removal of the subsidy caps for manufacturers, which means models by market leaders can now benefit from purchase incentives. In the longer-term, the list of models eligible for subsidies is expected to expand.\nThe 2023 outlook for electric cars is bright\nEarly indications from first quarter sales of 2023 point to an upbeat market, supported by cost declines as well as strengthened policy support in key markets such as the United States. Globally, our current estimate is therefore for nearly 14 million electric cars to be sold in 2023, building on the more than 2.3 million already sold in the first quarter of the year. This represents a 35% increase in electric car sales in 2023 compared to 2022 and would bring the global electric sales share to around 18%, up from 14% in 2022.\nElectric car sales in the first three months of 2023 have shown strong signs of growth compared to the same period in 2022. In the United States, more than 320 000 electric cars were sold in the first quarter of 2023, 60% more than over the same period in 2022. Our current expectation is for this growth to be sustained throughout the year, with electric car sales reaching over 1.5 million in 2023, bringing the electric car sales share in the United States up to around 12% in 2023.\nIn China, electric car sales were off to a rough start in 2023, with January sales being 8% lower than in January 2022. The latest available data suggests a quick recovery: over the entire first quarter of 2023, electric car sales in China were more than 20% higher than in the first quarter of 2022, with more than 1.3 million electric cars being registered. For the remainder of 2023, we expect the generally favourable cost structure of electric cars to outweigh the effects of the phase-out of the NEV subsidy. As a result, our current expectation is for electric car sales in China to be more than 30% higher than in 2022 and reach around 8 million by the end of 2023, reaching a sales share of over 35% (from 29% in 2022).\nBased on recent trends and tightening CO\n2\ntargets not going into effect until 2025, the growth of electric car sales in Europe is expected to be the lowest of the three largest markets. In the first quarter of 2023, electric car sales in Europe increased by around 10% compared to the same period in 2022. For the full year, we currently expect electric car sales to increase by over 25%, with one-in-four cars sold in Europe being electric.\nOutside of the major EV markets, electric car sales are expected to reach around 900 000 in 2023 – 50% higher than in 2022. Electric car sales in India in the first quarter of 2023 are already double what they were in the same period in 2022. In India and across all regions outside the three major EV markets, electric car sales are expected to represent 2-3% of car sales in 2023, a relatively small yet growing share.\nThere are, of course, downside risks to the 2023 outlook: a sluggish global economy and the phase-out of subsidies for NEVs in China could reduce 2023 growth in global electric car sales. On the upside, new markets may open up more quickly than anticipated, as persistent high oil prices make the case for EVs stronger in an increasing number of settings. And new policy developments, such as the April 2023 proposal from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to strengthen GHG emissions standards for cars, may send signals that boost sales even before going into effect.\nElectric car models\nThe number of electric car models rises, especially for large cars and SUVs, at the same time as it decreases for conventional cars\nThe race to electrification is increasing the number of electric car models available on the market. In 2022, the number of available options reached 500, up from below 450 in 2021 and more than doubling relative to 2018-2019. As in previous years, China has the broadest portfolio with nearly 300 available models, double the number available in 2018-2019, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. This remains nearly twice as many as in Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom, which all have around 150 models available, more than three times as many as before the pandemic. In the United States, there were fewer than 100 models available in 2022, but twice as many as before the pandemic; and 30 or fewer were available in Canada, Japan and Korea.\nBreakdown of available cars by powertrain and segment, 2022\nOpen\nexpand\nThe 2022 trend reflects the increasing maturity of EV markets and demonstrates that carmakers are responding to increasing consumer demand for electric cars. However, the number of electric car models available remains much lower than that of conventional ICE cars, which has remained above 1 250 since 2010 and peaked at 1 500 in the middle of the past decade. In recent years, the number of ICE models sold has been steadily\ndecreasing\n, at a compound annual growth rate of minus 2% over the 2016-2022 period, reaching about 1 300 models in 2022. This dip varies across major car markets and is most pronounced in China, where the number of available ICE options was 8% lower in 2022 than in 2016, versus 3-4% lower in the United States and Europe over the same period. This could result from contracting car markets and a progressive shift towards EVs among major carmakers. Looking forward, the total number of ICE models available could remain stable, while the number of\nnew models\nshrinks, if carmakers focus on electrification and keep selling existing ICE options rather than increasing budgets to develop new models.\nIn contrast to ICE models, EV model availability has been growing quickly, at a compound annual growth rate of 30% over the 2016-2022 period. Such growth is to be expected in a nascent market with a large number of new entrants bringing innovative products to the market, and as incumbents diversify their portfolios. Growth has been slightly lower in recent years: the annual growth rate stood at around 25% in 2021 and 15% in 2022. In the future, the number of models can be expected to continue to increase quickly, as major carmakers expand their EV portfolios and new entrants strengthen their positions, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). The historic number of ICE models available on the market suggests that the current number of EV options could double, at least, before stabilising.\nElectric car model availability in selected countries by size, 2018-2022\nOpen\nexpand\nSUVs and large car models dominate both EV and ICE markets\nA major concern for global car markets – both EV and ICE – is the overwhelming dominance of SUVs and large models among available options. Carmakers are able to generate higher revenues from such models, given higher profit margins, which can cover some of the investments made in developing electric options. In certain cases, such as in the United States, larger vehicles can also benefit from less stringent fuel economy standards, hence creating an incentive for carmakers to slightly increase the vehicle size of a car for it to qualify as a light truck.\nHowever, large models are more expensive, which poses significant affordability issues across the board, and all the more so in EMDEs. Large models also have implications for sustainability and supply chains, being equipped with larger batteries that require more critical minerals. In 2022, the sales-weighted average battery size of small battery electric cars ranged from 25 kWh in China to 35 kWh across France, Germany and the United Kingdom, and about 60 kWh in the United States. In comparison, the average for battery electric SUVs was around 70-75 kWh in these countries, and within the 75-90 kWh range for large car models.\nTransitioning\nfrom ICE to electric is a priority for achieving net zero emissions targets, regardless of vehicle size, but mitigating the impacts of higher battery sizes will also be important. In France, Germany and the United Kingdom in 2022, the sales-weighted average weight of a battery electric SUV was 1.5 times higher than the average small battery electric car, requiring greater amounts of steel, aluminium and plastic; the battery in the SUV was twice as large, requiring about 75% more critical minerals. The CO\n2\nemissions associated with materials processing, manufacturing and assembly can be estimated at more than 70% higher as a result.\nAt the same time, in 2022, electric SUVs resulted in the displacement of over 150 000 barrels per day of oil consumption and avoided the associated tailpipe emissions that would have been generated through burning the fuel in combustion engines. Although electric SUVs represented roughly 35% of all electric passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) in 2022, their share of oil displacement was even higher (about 40%), as SUVs tend to be driven more than smaller cars. Of course, smaller vehicles generally require less energy to operate and less materials to build, but electric SUVs certainly remain favourable to ICE vehicles.\nIn 2022, ICE SUVs\nemitted\nmore than 1 Gt CO\n2\n, far greater than the 80 Mt net emissions reductions from the electric vehicle fleet that year. While total car sales decreased by 0.5% in 2022, SUV sales increased by 3% relative to 2021, accounting for about 45% of total car sales, with noticeable growth in the United States, India and Europe. Of the 1 300 available options for ICE cars in 2022, more than 40% were SUVs, compared to fewer than 35% for small and medium cars. The total number of available ICE options went down from 2016 to 2022, but the drop was only for small and medium cars (down 35%) while large cars and SUVs increased (up 10%).\nSimilar trends are observed in EV markets. Around 16% of all SUVs sold were electric in 2022, which is above the overall market share of EVs and demonstrates consumer preferences for SUVs regardless of whether they are an ICE vehicle or EV. Nearly 40% of all BEV models available in 2022 were SUVs, which is equivalent to the shares of small and medium car options combined. Other large models accounted for more than 15%. Just 3 years before, in 2019, small and medium models accounted for 60% of all available models, and SUVs just 30%.\nIn China and Europe, SUVs and large models accounted for 60% of available BEV options in 2022, on par with the world average. As a comparison, ICE SUVs and large models accounted for about 70% of available ICE options in these regions, suggesting that electric cars currently remain somewhat smaller than their ICE equivalents. Announcements by some major European carmakers indicate that there could be a greater focus on smaller, more popular models in the years to come. For example,\nVolkswagen\nhas announced the launch of a compact model for the European market under EUR 25 000 by 2025 and under EUR 20 000 by 2026-2027, as a means to appeal to a broader consumer base. In the United States, over 80% of available BEV options in 2022 were SUVs or large car models, which is greater than the share of ICE SUVs or large models at 70%. Looking ahead, more electric SUVs are to be expected in the United States, should recent policy announcements on\nexpansion\nof IRA incentives to more SUVs be implemented. Following the IRA, the US Treasury has been\nrevising\nvehicle classifications, and in 2023 changed the eligibility criteria for clean vehicle credits relevant to smaller SUVs, which are now eligible if priced under USD 80 000, up from the previous limit of USD 55 000.\nElectric cars remain much cheaper in China\nThe growth in electric car sales in China has been underpinned by sustained policy support, but also cheaper retail prices. In 2022, the sales-weighted average price of a small BEV in China was below USD 10 000. This is significantly less than the prices of small BEVs found in Europe and the United States, where the sales-weighted average price exceeded USD 30 000 in the same year.\nIn China, the best-selling electric cars in 2022 were the Wuling Mini BEV, a small model priced at under USD 6 500, and BYD’s Dolphin, another small model, below USD 16 000. Together, these two models accounted for nearly 15% of Chinese BEV passenger car sales, illustrating the appetite for smaller models. To compare, the best-selling small BEVs across France, Germany and the United Kingdom – Fiat’s 500, Peugeot’s e-208 and Renault’s Zoe – were all priced above USD 35 000. Few small BEVs were sold in the United States, limited mainly to Chevrolet’s Bolt and the Mini Cooper BEV, which are priced around USD 30 000. Tesla’s Y Model was the best-selling BEV passenger car in both the selected European countries (priced at more than USD 65 000) and the United States (more than USD 50 000).\n6\nChinese carmakers have focused on developing smaller and more affordable models in advance of their international peers, cutting down costs following years of tough competition domestically. Hundreds of small EV manufacturers have entered the market since the 2000s, benefitting from a variety of public support schemes, including subsidies and incentives for both consumers and manufacturers. The majority of these firms went bankrupt due to competition as subsidies were gradually phased out, and the market has since consolidated around a dozen frontrunners, which have succeeded in developing small and cheap electric cars for the Chinese market. Vertical integration of battery and EV supply chains from mineral processing to battery and EV manufacturing, as well as cheaper labour, manufacturing and access to finance across the board, have also contributed to developing cheaper models.\nMeanwhile, carmakers in Europe and the United States – both early developers such as Tesla and incumbent major manufacturers – have mostly focused on larger or more luxurious models to date, hence offering few options affordable for mass-market consumers. However, the small options available in these countries typically offer greater performance than those in China, such as longer driving range. In 2022, the sales-weighted average range of small BEVs sold in the United States was nearly 350 km, while in France, Germany and the United Kingdom it was just under 300 km, compared to under 220 km in China. For other segments, the differences are less significant. The broader availability of public charging points in China may, in part, explain why consumers there have been more willing to opt for lower driving ranges than their European or American counterparts.\nIn 2022, Tesla heavily reduced the price of its models on two occasions as competition increased, and many carmakers have also announced cheaper options in the coming years. While these announcements warrant further examination, this trend could indicate that the price gap between small electric cars and incumbent ICE options could progressively close during this decade.\nEmerging markets\nEmerging markets see encouraging growth\nChina, Europe and the United States – the three major markets for electric cars – accounted for about 95% of global sales in 2022. Emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) outside China account for only a fraction of the global electric car market. Demand for electric cars has increased in recent years, but sales remain low.\nWhile EMDEs often quickly adopt low-cost emerging technology products (e.g. smartphones, computers and connected devices), electric cars remain typically too expensive for the majority of the population. According to a\nrecent survey\n, over 50% of Ghanaian respondents would prefer to purchase an EV to an ICE vehicle, but more than half of those potential consumers would not be willing to spend more than USD 20 000 for an electric car. Lack of access to reliable and affordable charging can be a barrier, as can limited access to EV servicing, maintenance and repair. In most EMDEs, road transport remains largely based on smaller mobility solutions in urban centres, such as two- and three-wheelers, which have seen much greater success in terms of electrification, as well as shared mobility for regional commutes. Purchasing behaviour is also different, with lower personal car ownership rates and more common purchase of used cars. Looking forward, while sales of electric cars – both new and used – can be expected to increase in EMDEs, it is likely that many countries will continue to rely primarily on two- and three-wheelers (see subsequent section on these vehicles in this report).\nThere was a notable boom in electromobility in 2022 in India, Thailand and Indonesia. Collectively, sales of electric cars in these countries more than tripled relative to 2021, reaching nearly 80 000. Sales in 2022 were 7 times higher than in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic. In contrast, sales in other EMDEs were lower.\nIn India, BEV sales reached nearly 50 000 in 2022, 4 times more than in 2021, while total car sales increased by just below 15%. Leading domestic manufacturer Tata accounted for over 85% of BEV sales, including through sales of its small BEV Tigor/Tiago, which quadrupled. Indian PHEV sales remained close to zero. Burgeoning electromobility companies are now betting on the government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme – with around USD 2 billion in subsidy programmes – to ramp up EV and component manufacturing. This scheme has\nattracted\ninvestments totalling USD 8.3 billion.\nThe Indian market, however, currently remains geared towards shared and smaller mobility. In 2022,\n25%\nof electric car purchases in India were by fleet operators, such as for taxis. In early 2023, Tata secured a large\norder\nfrom Uber for 25 000 electric cars. Furthermore, while 55% of three-wheelers sold were electric, fewer than 2% of cars sold were EVs.\nOla\n, India’s top EV company by revenue, does not yet offer electric cars. Ola is instead concentrating on smaller mobility and\naims\nto double its electric two-wheeler manufacturing capacity to 2 million by the end of 2023, and to reach an annual production capacity of 10 million between 2025 and 2028. The company also seeks to build lithium-ion battery manufacturing facilities, initially at 5 GWh capacity, scaling up to 100 GWh by 2030. Ola aims to start marketing electric cars for its taxi business by 2024 and to make its fleet of taxis fully electric by 2029, while launching its own electric car business for both the high-end and mass markets. It\nannounced\nover USD 900 million of investments for battery and EV manufacturing in Southern India, and an increase in annual production from 100 000 to 140 000 vehicles.\nElectric car sales by powertrain and available models by car size in selected regions, 2018-2022\nOpen\nexpand\nElectric car sales by powertrain and available models by car size in selected countries, 2018-2022\nOpen\nexpand\nIn Thailand, electric car sales doubled to 21 000, equally distributed between BEVs and PHEVs. The emerging presence of Chinese carmakers has accelerated EV adoption in the country. In 2021, Chinese original equipment manufacturer (OEM)\nGreat Wall Motors\nlaunched its Ora Good Cat BEV model in the Thai market, and in 2022 it became the most sold electric car in Thailand, with nearly 4 000 sales. The second and third best-selling cars were also Chinese, manufactured by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), none of which were sold in the country in 2020. Chinese automakers were able to undercut EV prices from foreign competitors also present in the Thai market, such as BMW and Mercedes, thereby appealing to a broader consumer base. In addition, the Thai government offers various financial incentives for electric cars, including subsidies, excise duty waivers and import tax reductions, which have contributed to making electric cars more attractive. Tesla is planning to enter the Thai market in 2023 along with building Superchargers.\nIn Indonesia, BEV sales multiplied by more than 14, exceeding 10 000, while PHEV sales remained close to zero. In March 2023, Indonesia announced\nnew incentives\nto support sales of electric two-wheelers, cars and buses, with the aim of strengthening domestic capacity in EV and battery manufacturing through local component requirements. The government aims to subsidise the sale of 200 000 electric two-wheelers and 36 000 electric cars in 2023, reaching a sales share of 4% and 5% respectively. The new subsidies could reduce the price of an electric two-wheeler by 25-50% to help compete against ICE equivalents. Indonesia plays an important\nrole\nin EV and battery supply chains, in particular given its abundant raw mineral resources and status as the world’s largest nickel miner. This has attracted investment from global companies, and Indonesia could become the\nlargest\nmanufacturing hub in the region for batteries and components.\nModel availability remains an issue in EMDEs, with many of the options on sale heavily geared towards the higher end, such as SUVs, large and luxury models. While the trend for SUVs is global, purchasing power is more limited in EMDEs, making such vehicles largely unaffordable. Across the different regions considered in this section of the report, for a total of more than 60 EMDEs, including those which receive support from the Global Environment Facility’s (GEF) Global E-Mobility Programme, there were two to six times more large models available than small ones in 2022.\nIn Africa, the best-selling electric car model in 2022 was the Hyundai Kona, a crossover BEV, and there were about as many recorded sales of Porsche’s large and expensive Taycan BEV as there were of Nissan’s medium-sized Leaf BEV. There were also eight times more sales of electric SUVs than of the Mini Cooper SE BEV and Renault Zoe BEV combined, the two best-selling small electric cars. In India, the best-selling electric car model was Tata’s crossover Nexon BEV, with over 32 000 sales, or three times more than the second best-selling model, Tata’s small Tigor/Tiago BEV. Across all of the EMDEs considered here, sales of electric SUVs reached 45 000, which is more than the sales of small (23 000) and medium (16 000) electric cars combined. In Costa Rica, the leading country in Latin America in terms of BEV sales share, only 4 models in the top 20 were not SUVs, and nearly a third were luxury models. The future of mass-market electrification in EMDEs relies on the development of smaller, more affordable electric cars, alongside two- and three-wheelers.\nOn the distinction between vehicle registrations and vehicle sales\nAn important distinction for assessing the evolution of vehicle markets is the difference between registrations and sales. New registrations represent the number of vehicles that have been officially registered for the first time with the relevant government ministry or insurance agency, including domestically produced and imported vehicles. Sales can either refer to vehicles sold by dealers or agencies (retail sales), or to vehicles sold to dealers by vehicle manufacturers (factory shipments, i.e. including exports). The choice of metric can make a significant difference when analysing vehicle markets. For consistency in accounting across all countries, and to avoid double-counting at a global level, in this report vehicle market sizes are based on new vehicle registrations, where available, and retail sales otherwise, not on factory shipments.\nChina’s vehicle market trends in 2022 are a good illustration of why this matters. In 2022, an\nincrease of 7 to 10% in factory shipments\n(reported as sales) for the Chinese passenger car market was reported, while insurance registrations showed a stagnation of the domestic market in the same year. This increase was observed in data from the\nChina Association of Automobile Manufacturers\n(CAAM), which is the official data source for China’s car industry. CAAM data is collected from car manufacturers and represents factory shipments. Another widely referenced source is the\nChina Passenger Car Association\n(\nCPCA\n), a non-governmental organisation that provides wholesale, retail sales and exports for passenger cars, but is not qualified to provide national statistics, and it does not cover all OEMs, whereas CAAM does. The\nChina Automotive Technology and Research Center\n(CATARC) is a state-owned think tank, and collects car production numbers from vehicle identification numbers and car sales numbers from vehicle insurance registrations. In China, vehicle insurance is registered for the vehicle itself and not for the individual driver, and is therefore useful for tracking the number of vehicles on the road, including imports. The main differences between CATARC data and the other sources stem from exports and military or other cars that do not get registered, and inventory stocks of vehicle manufacturers.\nIn 2022 the total exports of passenger cars increased rapidly, making the differences between these data sources more apparent. In 2022\nthe export of passenger vehicles increased by almost 60%,\nexceeding 2.5 million, while the imports of passenger vehicles decreased by almost 20% (950 000 to 770 000).\nSimilar discrepancies between factory shipments and insurance registrations are apparent in the Chinese bus and truck (commercial vehicle) market. In both 2021 and 2022, total volumes of factory shipments were substantially higher than insurance registrations, implying net export shares of commercial vehicles of about 9% in 2021 and more than 13% in 2022.\nNumber of commerical vehicle sales and vehicle registration in China reported by various sources, 2020-2022\nOpen\nexpand\nNumber of passenger car sales and insurance registration in China reported by various sources, 2020-2022\nOpen\nexpand\nElectric light commercial vehicles\nSales of electric light commercial vehicles continue to increase, catching up with electric car sales\nElectric light commercial vehicle (LCV) sales worldwide nearly doubled in 2022 relative to 2021 to more than 310 000 vehicles, even as overall LCV sales declined by more than 10%. At a global level, the electric LCV sales share is 3.6%, about one-quarter that of passenger cars. Current trends indicate that the electric LCV market is catching up with that of electric cars, suggesting that the gap in terms of EV sales shares could narrow in the future. For the first time in 2022, the increase in the share of electric LCVs outpaced that of electric passenger cars (albeit from a low base). This demonstrates that once a\ncritical tipping point\nin terms of favourability of total cost of ownership (TCO) has been achieved, commercial vehicle purchasers are likely to respond\nmore rapidly\nto economic fundamentals than private consumers. Commercial vehicle owners typically use their vehicles more intensively, and as they have an imperative to maximise profit, EVs provide an opportunity to considerably reduce operating costs. The experience of commercial owners can also provide learnings for the private consumers segment: better fleet and charging management could help address concerns over range limitations.\nThe share of PHEVs in LCVs has remained very low; around 98% of both electric LCV sales and stock in 2022 were BEVs. It is likely that this reflects the economic favourability of the battery electric powertrain – as opposed to plug-in hybrids – in commercial operations characterised by intensive usage, regularity and predictability (in terms of driving range, geographic extent, and return-to-base for overnight charging), as well as the lower maintenance and service costs of battery electric LCVs. Battery electric LCV adoption may also be spurred on by the continuing expansion of low- and zero-emission zones.\nElectric light commercial vehicle (LCV) sales and sales shares, 2018-2022\nOpen\nexpand\nIn 2022, China led in terms of overall electric LCV sales with over 130 000 units sold, and nearly 15% of LCVs sold being electric.\n7\nSubsidies for battery electric and fuel cell trucks and vocational vehicles (including LCVs) have decreased in recent years, but overall zero-emission commercial truck sales have been growing since 2020, even as subsidies per vehicle have declined, indicating the increasing commercial competitiveness of electric trucks.\nIn terms of market share, Korea continued to lead in 2022 with 27% of LCV sales being electric (36 000 vehicles), but sales growth in 2022 slowed to half its level in the previous year. This may be due to\nchanges\nto the subsidy scheme for LCVs and to the repealing in April 2022 of a policy that made obtaining commercial registration permits\neasier\nfor electric LCVs than ICE models (see\nPolicy developments and corporate strategy\n).\nLight commercial EV sales shares also grew substantially in the Nordic countries, with Norway reaching 25%, Iceland 16%, and Sweden 13%. In all other key European and North American national markets, shares are lower than 10%, and typically less than the global average of 3.5%, but the rate of growth in market share for electric LCVs was higher than for passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) (albeit from a lower baseline) across most leading EV markets, including the United States, Japan, and the European Union.\nElectric two- and three-wheelers\nElectric two-wheeler sales declined in China while global electric three-wheeler sales continued to rise\nGlobal electric two-wheeler sales totalled about 9.2 million in 2022, a drop of nearly 18% from 2021. This drop is almost entirely attributable to the dip in sales of electric mopeds and motorcycles in China, which fell from 10.2 million in 2021 to under 7.7 million in 2022, even as the overall two-wheeler market there continued to grow. Supply chain challenges stemming from China’s pandemic-related restrictions in 2022 hit the electric two-wheeler market particularly hard, and in spite of growth in sales of premium domestic and imported two-wheelers (e.g. from BMW, Ducati and others), the overall sales share of electric two-wheelers dipped back below 50%.\n8\nDespite the decline in sales, China continued to dominate the electric two-wheeler market in terms of size, accounting for nearly 85% of global sales.\nElectric two-wheelers also lost market share in Viet Nam, despite sales shares of domestically produced electric two-wheelers having\nincreased considerably\nin recent years. In terms of absolute volumes, sales grew in most Asian markets outside China and Viet Nam.\nIndia leads on sales of electric three-wheelers thanks to policy support and innovative business models\nSales of electric three-wheelers, which play an important role in urban mobility in India for both cargo and passenger services, soared to 425 000 units in 2022. Sales have been strong in India for a number of years, with hundreds of thousands of electric three-wheelers sold every year since 2012, with the exception of 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reduced sales volumes to 30% of the previous year.\nOver half of India’s three-wheeler registrations in 2022 were electric, demonstrating their growing popularity due government incentives and lower lifecycle costs compared with conventional models, as well as higher fuel prices. IEA analysis on the TCO in India suggests that electric three-wheelers are already 70% cheaper than their gasoline-power ICE equivalents over their lifetime (IEA, forthcoming).\nPolicies including the purchase incentives under FAME II, supply-side incentives under the PLI scheme, tax benefits and India’s Go Electric campaign all contributed to reducing the higher upfront costs (see\nPolicy developments and corporate strategy\nfor a detailed discussion of these and other policies). A total of\n15 Indian states\nhave already adopted EV policies to promote stronger EV deployment (and\nmany more\nare drafting them), the majority of which include additional demand incentives. Bulk procurement schemes, the emergence of the battery-as-a-service (BaaS) business model and India’s draft battery swapping policy all give further impetus to the rapidly rising sales of electric three-wheelers.\nChina followed India in terms of electric three-wheeler sales, with nearly 350 000 units sold in 2022. Together, China and India accounted for nearly 99% of global electric three-wheeler sales.\nKorea continues to lead fuel cell electric car growth\nIn 2022, the stock of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) increased 40% compared to 2021, reaching over 72 000 vehicles globally. About 80% of the FCEVs are cars, 10% trucks and almost 10% buses. In 2022, the fuel cell truck segment grew at a faster rate than cars and buses, increasing 60%.\nKorea is now home to over half of all fuel cell cars globally. Two-thirds of the additional 15 000 fuel cell cars that hit the road in 2022 were in Korea. This can be attributed in part to a policy landscape that supports FCEV production and sales, which has also led to Hyundai being the top fuel cell automaker.\nThe United States holds the second largest FCEV stock, with over 15 000 FCEVs. Most of these are fuel cell cars, with a little more than 200 fuel cell buses. In 2022, the stock of FCEVs in the United States increased more than 20%, which is much less than the 60% growth in China, which has the third largest FCEV stock.\nHistorically, China has dominated the heavy-duty fuel cell vehicle segments (trucks and buses). This is still the case in 2022, with China home to over 95% of the global fuel cell truck fleet and almost 85% of the global fuel cell bus fleet. However, in 2022, China added over 200 fuel cell cars to its FCEV fleet after years of only deploying buses and trucks.\nFor further details on the status of FCEVs and other hydrogen-based applications, see the IEA\nGlobal Hydrogen Review\nreport series.\nFuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) stock by region and by mode, 2022\nOpen\nexpand\nShare of fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) and hydrogen refuelling station (HRS) stock by region, 2022\nOpen\nexpand\nReferences\nThe term sales, as used in this report, represents an estimate of the number of new vehicles hitting the roads.

A young entrepreneur building the next generation of Autotrader.\ngetty\nDigital transformation is impacting every industry, and the automotive industry is no exception. With electric and hybrid vehicles on the road increasing significantly over the past 10 years, the automotive industry is experiencing the biggest revolution since the invention of the Model T.\nThere were more than\n10 million electric vehicles (EV)s\non the road in 2020, and with this shift in car buying trends comes new consumer behavior. The manufacturers and dealerships that understand this shift—and evolve simultaneously with their sales, marketing, and customer experience—will be the ones that find the most success.\nThose buying EVs aren’t researching miles per gallon and sports packages. Instead, consumers are checking battery range, charging networks, and technology functionality. What actually\nmatters\nto the consumer has changed, and thus, their buying behaviors. An increased awareness around sustainability, as well as a general distaste in and distrust of the dealership experience, are just two reasons why EVs are shaking up the auto business.\nMillennials, like myself, simply don’t want to engage in the traditional car-buying experience. We are happy to trade five-hour car dealership experiences for 10 clicks or less to buy a car online. A recent\nNew York Times\narticle\nshared that millennials were almost twice as likely to shop for and buy a car completely online. They want more transparency into car pricing and an easier, less convoluted buying experience. The in-person sales pitch at the dealership just isn’t working for this generation. The manufacturers and dealerships that embrace this new way of thinking have the best chances of outmaneuvering their competition.\nRecent studies\nshow that the average EV owner has remained the same over the past 10 years,: 40-55 year old males with an annual household income of more than $100,000. But as sales continue to increase at a fast rate, year over year, it’s likely new trends and demographics will emerge.\nWith EV prices likely to become more affordable in coming years, we’ll probably see more millennials get behind the wheel of a battery-powered car. In recent research,\nThe Fuels Institute\nfound a collection of trends that leads a consumer to ultimately make a purchase: “Affordability, availability, and familiarity appear to be amongst the key factors influencing likelihood of EV purchases.”\nOverall,\nMcKinsey\npredicts an industry- and consumer-wide adoption of EVs in the next decade. “In 2030, the share of electrified vehicles could range from 10 percent to 50 percent of new-vehicle sales. Adoption rates will be highest in developed dense cities with strict emission regulations and consumer incentives (tax breaks, special parking and driving privileges, discounted electricity pricing, etc).” The more environmentally focused a city or state, the more likely that area will have higher numbers of EVs.\nInterestingly, one of the biggest concerns for current and potential EV buyers is “range anxiety.” According to\nKalibrate\n, more than 50% of drivers are worried that an EV will run out of charge while traveling. A lack of charging stations, as well as faulty or broken stations, is also concerning for car buyers contemplating an EV.\nWith most EV drivers recharging daily or once every two days, and usually at home or at a workplace parking lot, the worry is less around regular commutes to work. In fact, according to Fuel Institute, “most EV fleet customers today (2020) operate in a hub-and-spoke network and exclusively recharge their vehicles overnight at their home base.”\nDrivers are much more concerned about running out of charge on longer trips when planned stops to recharge are necessary. Once the decision to buy an EV is made, one of the first considerations is the network of charging stations. And\nresearch shows\nthat charging infrastructure remains a barrier. According to McKinsey, “Sales penetration will be slower in small towns and rural areas with lower levels of charging infrastructure and higher dependency on driving range.”\nAs the automotive industry continues to navigate the digital revolutions, it’s imperative for manufacturers and dealerships to evolve with the changing times. Future success depends on adopting new sales and marketing strategies and understanding the dynamics needs of the customer.\nForbes Business Council\nis the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.\nDo I qualify?\nFollow me on\nTwitter\nor\nLinkedIn\n.\nCheck out\nmy\nwebsite\n.\nJoel Li\nEditorial Standards\nPrint\nReprints & Permissions",

Roughly a decade ago, EVs accounted for a tiny fraction of overall car sales. As of March 2023, they make up 7% of new sales.\nFaculty\nKenneth Gillingham\nSenior Associate Dean of Academic Affairs; Professor of Environmental & Energy Economics\n“What changed between then and now?” asks Kenneth Gillingham, professor of environmental and energy economics at the Yale School of the Environment. “Was it that consumers suddenly decided they like EVs much more, or was it that EVs themselves got a lot better?”\nNew research by Gillingham,\npublished in\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\n, finds that recent adoption of EVs is driven overwhelmingly by technological advances, while general consumer preferences for EVs has changed little. Improvements like increased battery range, faster charging, falling prices, and reduced operating costs have made EVs an enticing option alongside their gas-powered counterparts. (Range proved particularly important, with cars that can travel 300 miles or more on a single charge essentially as attractive as comparable gas cars in consumers’ minds, the study reveals.)\nGillingham and Carnegie Mellon University coauthors surveyed about 1,600 people who had intentions of purchasing a car or SUV within the next two years or who had purchased one within the prior year. Respondents were shown 15 sets of three vehicles with various attributes — some gasoline powered, some electric, some hybrid — and asked which one they would choose. The results from this survey were matched with results from a similar survey conducted in 2012 and 2013, and from this comparison the researchers were able to discern how much new adoption of EVs was due to consumer preferences and how much was due to technological advancements. This prompted another inquiry.\n“The big question is what happens next,” Gillingham says.\nWe really could have EVs making up a majority of all cars sold by 2030.”\nKenneth Gillingham\nProfessor of Environmental and Energy Economics\nTo answer this, the researchers paired the consumer adoption trends that they revealed with forecasted improvements in vehicle technology and predicted new EV offerings. Gillingham notes that there are more than 100 new EV models slated to become available globally in the next three to four years. Taken together, this information suggests that EVs could account for 40-60% of all new cars and SUVs sold by 2030.  In short, it is possible that EVs could dominate the market only seven years from now.\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to “YSE 3”\nBiweekly, we highlight three news and research stories about the work we’re doing at Yale School of the Environment.\nFor policymakers, the authors note, the findings suggest that rapid change and ambitious goals might be achievable. Gillingham cites one of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s recently proposed rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions for cars and small trucks that, if adopted, could lead to EVs comprising about two-thirds of all new vehicle sales by 2032.\n“Our study doesn’t say by any means that it is going to happen, but it isn’t beyond the realm of possibility. We really could have EVs making up a majority of all cars sold by 2030,” Gillingham says.\nThe implications also are clear for manufacturers — and many have already responded to evident shifts in the market. GM announced plans to sell only EVs by 2035. Lexus, under Toyota, announced the same goal. The findings from this research, Gillingham suggests, support the deep investment required by such a transition.\n“Vehicle manufacturers who are leaders in the EV space will take comfort in what we’ve found,” he says. “Manufacturers who are laggards might want to think carefully about what their plans are.”\nPublished\nMay 28, 2023\nTags\nKenneth Gillingham\nResearch\nEnergy and the Environment\nEnvironmental Policy Analysis\nFaculty\nMedia Contact\nFran Silverman\nAssociate Director of Communications\nfran.silverman@yale.edu\n203-436-4842\nResearch in the News\nView More Stories\nNews\nAchieving Sustainable Urban Growth on a Global Scale\nNews\nClarifying the Costs of Addressing Climate Change\nNews\nYale Awarded Energy Earthshot to Study Natural Carbon Capture\nGo to the previous slide.\nGo to the next slide.\nConnect with us\nRequest Information\nRegister for Events\nApply\nYale School of the Environment\nVisit the Yale School of the Environment homepage\n195 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT 06511\n(203) 432-5100\nadmissions.yse@yale.edu\nSocial Media Links\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\nAcademic Programs\nAdmissions\nLearning Communities\nResearch & Impact\nStudent Experience\nAbout\nFooter Util\nMedia Inquiries\nFor Employers\nJob Opportunities\nSign Up for Our Newsletter\nCopyright © 2024,\nYale University\n.

They found that consumers’ preferences for vehicle attributes, like longer range and cheaper operation, haven’t changed much, but they are more willing to adopt EVs as technology improves. With expected range increases and price decreases, the team predicted that demand for electric cars and SUVs could be comparable to gasoline cars and SUVs by 2030.\nThe team includes\nJeremy Michalek\n, a professor of\nmechanical engineering\nand\nengineering and public policy\n;\nKate Whitefoot\n, an associate professor mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy; their Ph.D. student Connor Forsythe, and Ken Gillingham, an economics professor at Yale.\nTechnology has progressed rapidly in the field of EVs. In the past decade, average EV efficiency has increased by 15 percent, while average range has increased by about 200 percent. The availability of EV models on the market has improved significantly, and the price-premium has dropped over time. Amidst these trends, states like California have adopted policies limiting the sale of new gasoline-only vehicles, and manufacturers like General Motors have called for stronger policies promoting new EV sales.\nWith these factors in mind, the team first conducted a survey of more than 1,500 prospective vehicle buyers to determine what factors influence their purchasing decisions. They then compared these results to those of a similar consumer survey conducted from 2012-2013. This helped them track changes in the market over time and allowed them to project how demand will grow through 2030. They found no statistically significant changes in consumer preferences for electric vehicles and electric vehicle attributes over this time, but estimated that the same consumer preferences would produce higher EV adoption as EVs catch up to gasoline vehicles on key attributes like range and price.\nThey estimated that if technology trends continue as expected and if EVs become as ubiquitous as gasoline vehicles by 2030, car and SUV buyers will become near indifferent between the two, on average.\nFor the policy makers and industry leaders attempting to plot the future of the automotive market, this information is crucial. Understanding market forces and our current course can help ensure that the U.S. is on a path toward reducing the nation’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions.\nFor media inquiries, please contact Dan Carroll at\ndccarrol@andrew.cmu.edu\n.\nView Next Article\nContact\nMake a gift\nFor faculty & staff\nAbout us\nDirectory\nCarnegie Mellon University\nCollege of Engineering\n5000 Forbes Avenue\nPittsburgh\n,\nPA\n15213\n©2024 Carnegie Mellon University\nLegal\n“Do your duty and a little more and the future will take care of itself.”\nAndrew Carnegie\n“As engineers, we were going to be in a position to change the world — not just study it.”\nHenry Petroski\n“Imagination is more important than knowledge.

Electric vehicle trends for 2024 include lower electric car prices, an expansion of EV charging stations, and greater EV charging plug compatibility. Read on to learn about EV industry trends and how they're shaping the future of the electric vehicle market in the coming year.\nEV Sales Will Continue Rising in 2024\nSales are expected to keep growing in 2024, despite some reports suggesting a decline in 2023. Even though more EVs are sitting unsold at dealerships, the actual electric car sales numbers are still strong and their market share is growing. There will be nearly\n1.9 million EV sales\nin the U.S. in 2024, according to projections.\nThe third quarter of 2023 showed the best market growth in EV sales since late 2021, and by September, over\n1 million new EVs were sold in 2023\n. Though\nEV sales estimates for 2024\nwere adjusted down a bit, they still predict a 20% increase from 2023. Cox Automotive also thinks that in 2024, more than 10% of all vehicle sales will be electric, and when including hybrid vehicles, almost 24% of 2024 vehicle sales will be electric or hybrid.\nGlobal EV Industry Sales\nEV sales in 2024 are expected to be highest in China, followed by Europe, North America, South Korea, and Japan. In fact, six out of every ten EV sales globally are from China, where\nintensifying competition\nis driving down costs and manufacturer profits. Historically, EV sales have increased annually, and this trend is expected to continue throughout 2024.\nDeclining Prices Will Make the EV Market More Affordable\nThere are numerous\nEVs available for under $40,000\nin 2024, especially after applying the federal EV tax credit. Although some car shoppers are priced out of the EV market, prices of electric passenger cars will continue to decrease for some models due to technology advancements. For example, as automakers enhance their battery technologies and formulations, it's anticipated that EV battery prices will decrease.\nThis improvement allows for both extended battery ranges and reduced costs. Considering that batteries make up around\n40% of an EV’s total cost\n, reducing battery expenses is likely to significantly decrease the overall price of EVs, contributing to increased electric car sales. Thus, increasing affordability is an important electric vehicle industry trend for 2024.\nCharging Stations Will Advance Boosting EV Industry Growth\nIndeed EV charging station infrastructure isn’t evenly distributed across the U.S., and California leads the way in the amount of EV charging stations, with more than\n10,000 DC fast chargers\n. Yet,\nstudies show\nthat many Americans are wary of buying an EV due to charging issues.\n“Consumers need access to safe, reliable, convenient and affordable charging to drive and own an EV, and our research shows real concerns remain,” said\nMarc Coltelli\n, EY Americas eMobility Energy Leader. “At the EY organization, we are predicting 82 million EVs will be on US roads by 2035. To scale adoption, the challenge confronting America’s transition to EVs is instilling charging confidence among consumers. The energy industry has a massive role to play in this transition and is seizing the opportunity by collaborating cross-sector to build and power a resilient EV charging network.”\nSome achievements during 2023 will lay the groundwork for advances in charging infrastructure for the EV industry. These efforts will shape electric vehicle trends for 2024.\nMore EVs Will Become Compatible With Tesla Supercharging Network\nOne major advancement in EV charging relates to the charging ports on EVs, but a series of announcements in 2023 show signs of progress. A joint announcement by seven automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mercedes, Nissan, Rivian, and Volvo, reveals plans to adopt Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) for their electric vehicles.\nThis move is set to make the Tesla Supercharger network available to customers of these automakers from 2024 onwards. While most electric vehicles in the United States currently use the Combined Charging Station (CCS) charger plug, this shift signifies broader accessibility to Tesla's robust EV charging network.\nTesla’s Supercharger\nis the largest rapid EV charging station network, with over 45,000 chargers in the U.S. A\n2023 J.D. Power study\non EV charging infrastructure shows that Tesla owners are relatively happy with the Supercharger network, but their satisfaction declines considerably when using EV charging stations outside the Tesla network.\nHowever, Superchargers have historically only been compatible with Tesla vehicles, and the user experience may change when the network is opened up to non-Tesla drivers. It’s difficult to predict if non-Tesla EV drivers will have the same smooth vehicle charging experience when the network becomes available to them.\nAutomakers Partner to Create Massive EV Charging Station Network\nSeven major automakers unveiled plans last year for a collaborative effort to establish a\nhigh-powered electric vehicle charging network\nspanning North America, featuring 30,000 chargers. BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group, and Stellantis NV are joining forces to enhance the convenience, accessibility, and universal compatibility of EV charging.\nPositioned to rival Tesla Superchargers, this EV charging station network aims to capitalize on charger subsidies under the Biden administration. The electric car charging network, set to be operational in 2024 in the U.S. and later in Canada, will be open to any battery electric vehicle using either Tesla’s NACS or CCS charger plugs and will exclusively rely on renewable energy to combat climate change.\nChallenges for EV Charging Station Installers & Contractors\nThe growth of the EV industry is creating opportunities for contractors. As the demand for EV charging infrastructure installers continues to grow, contractors face several challenges in this dynamic landscape:\nEV Charging Station Technology:\nEV charging technology is evolving rapidly with new standards and protocols. Installers must stay updated on the latest trends to effectively install and maintain EV charging station infrastructure.\nPermitting, Code, and Zoning Requirements\n: Installing multi-family residential and\ncommercial EV charging stations\nusually involves permits and compliance with local regulations. Installers need to be well-versed in the permitting process to avoid delays and ensure regulatory adherence, or else partner with\nGreenLancer for permitting and engineering services\n.\nCompetition:\nWith the rising demand for EV charging stations, more players are entering the market. EV infrastructure installers must differentiate themselves through competitive pricing, excellent customer service, and expertise.\nOpportunities for EV Charging Station Installers & Contractors\nDespite the challenges, the future holds promise for EV charging station installers, making it a key EV industry trend for 2024.\nEmerging EV Charging Station Market\n: The demand for EV charging stations is expected to grow significantly, creating a vast market for installers.\nSkilled Contractor Workforce\n: The EV industry's expansion will increase the need for skilled professionals, providing job opportunities for electricians and technicians.\nOpportunities for Partnerships\n: EV charging station installers can explore partnerships with EV manufacturers, utilities, and GreenLancer to expand their reach and offer comprehensive EV charging solutions.\nElectric Vehicles Eligible for Tax Credits Change in 2024\nThe eligibility requirements for federal tax credits for battery electric vehicles (BEVs),\nplug-in hybrid electric vehicles\n(PHEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles have changed for vehicles placed in service between January 1 and December 31, 2024. Beginning in 2024, eligibility will be assessed on a per-vehicle basis rather than by model. Also, EV buyers must meet eligibility requirements, including income eligibility.\nAutomakers will submit the Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) of qualifying plug-in electric vehicles to the IRS, ensuring that only those specific vehicles are eligible for a tax credit. Car shoppers can obtain information from dealerships regarding the specific eligibility status of individual electric cars.\nOne of the best ways to determine if a specific electric vehicle is eligible is to refer to the\nTreasury Department\nlist.\nElectric Vehicles Eligible for $7,500 Tax Credit in 2024\nChevrolet Bolt and Bolt EUV\n(2022 and 2023 EV models, priced at or below $55,000, the Bolt was discontinued for the 2024 model year)\nChrysler Pacifica Hybrid PHEV\n(2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000)\nFord F-150 Lightning\n(2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000)\nTesla Model 3 Performance\n(2023 and 2024 models, priced at or below $55,000)\nTesla Model X Long Range\n(2023 and 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000)\nTesla Model Y All-Wheel Drive\n(2023 and 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000); Performance (2023 and 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000); and Rear-Wheel Drive (2024 model year only, priced at or below $80,000)\nElectric Vehicles Eligible for $3,750 Tax Credit in 2024\nFord Escape Plug-In Hybrid\n(2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000)\nJeep Grand Cherokee 4xe Plug-In Hybrid\n(2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000)\nJeep Wrangler 4xe Plug-In Hybrid SUV\n(2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000)\nLincoln Corsair Grand Touring Plug-In Hybrid\n(2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000)\nRivian R1S and R1T\n(2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000)\nEV Industry Growth in 2024 Creates Opportunities for Contractors\nThe electric vehicle market is experiencing significant growth. This trend towards sustainable transportation is motivated by various factors, including heightened environmental concerns and the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, widespread governmental incentives and policies supporting EV adoption, continuous advancements in battery technology resulting in longer driving ranges, and the decreasing costs of electric vehicles.\nAs the demand for electric vehicles intensifies, the necessity for fortifying the EV charging infrastructure becomes increasingly evident. Drivers depend on a robust network of electric car charging stations to ensure the continuous operation of their vehicles, presenting abundant opportunities for\nprofessionals within the EV charging station industry\n.\nGreenLancer works with contractors to simplify the EV charging station permitting and engineering process.

Here is how companies can capture the opportunity.\n(PDF-1 MB)\nAs more people and organizations\nacquire electric vehicles (EVs), companies will have chances to lift their revenues not only by selling more electric power and charging infrastructure but also by providing services that support the charging of EVs. EV fleets represent a particularly promising segment of the potential market for charging services, which can help fleet operators reduce their costs by procuring and managing energy in efficient ways. In the United States, the market for fleet-charging services could amount to $15 billion per year by 2030. Although this market is fragmented and undeveloped, it is not too early for companies to position themselves to compete in it. Companies should recognize that delivering these services will likely require new business modelsâand prepare accordingly.\nFinding the profit in EV fleet charging\nThanks to such factors as falling costs, widening availability, and support from policy makers, US sales of commercial EVs have continued to grow. Looking ahead, the operators of vehicle fleets may be especially enthusiastic buyers of EVs. EVs do cost more than comparable vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICEs). However, their superior efficiency, the moderate price of electricity, and the high utilization of fleet vehicles allow fleet operators to quickly recoup the extra up-front cost of an EV and achieve a lower total cost of ownership. Our estimate suggests that fleet EVs can have a total cost of ownership that is 15 to 25 percent less than that of equivalent ICE vehicles by 2030.\n1\nEstimates based on urban and regional use cases for commercial fleet vehicles.\nAssuming widespread EV adoption, McKinsey projects that commercial and passenger fleets in the United States could include as many as eight million EVs by 2030 (compared with fewer than 5,000 in 2018), which would amount to between 10 and 15 percent of all fleet vehicles. Powering those EVs will require a great deal of investment and infrastructure. McKinsey estimates that the United States will need some $11 billion of capital investment by 2030 to deploy the 13 million chargers needed for all of the countryâs EVs.\n2\nHauke Engel, Russell Hensley, Stefan Knupfer, and Shivika Sahdev, â\nCharging ahead: Electric-vehicle infrastructure demand\n,â August 2018.\nFleet EVs alone would consume up to 230 terawatt-hours of power per year, which would be approximately 6 percent of current US power generation. Their batteries would offer roughly 30 gigawatt-hours of electricity-storage capacity, or 15 to 20 percent of projected capacity in 2030.\nMass deployment of EV charging infrastructure will bring opportunities to run that equipment more efficiently and cost effectively. Our estimates indicate that services to support the charging of EV fleets could be worth some $15 billion in annual revenues and cost savings. Much of that money would come from three activities (exhibit).\n3\nThe projected cost reductions and revenue gains are based on the electric-vehicle-fleet-size projections presented in the article, along with projected renewable-power prices and demand charges to 2030. These do not account for the potential prices of fleet-charging services or the costs to deliver them, only for the differences between retail and wholesale energy prices, for the differences between peak and off-peak energy prices, and for avoided demand fees. Projections of the amounts of electric power that US-based electric-vehicle fleets will purchase directly from renewable sources and from the grid are based on an assumption that fleet operators will use the least expensive energy sources available (taking demand charges into account) in each region. Projections also assume that no major shifts in policy will affect the relative costs of directly purchased renewable power and grid power.\nProcuring renewable power directly from the source.\nPurchasing electricity directly from off-grid generation facilities, rather than the power grid, could yield $8.6 billion in cost savings, thanks to the difference between retail and wholesale energy prices (without accounting for avoided demand charges, which we discuss below). Our analysis suggests that in many geographies, the least expensive form of off-grid power would be solar, generated from on-site installations or purchased under direct contracts with large-scale installations.\nOffering energy-management services.\nCommercial-scale batteries would let fleet operators buy power during off-peak hours and use the stored power to recharge EVs when electricity prices are highest. Practicing time-of-use arbitrage in this way could produce cost savings of roughly $4.4 billion.\nProviding ancillary grid services.\nSelling power stored in EV batteries back to the grid during periods of peak demand, which is a form of âvehicle to gridâ (V2G) service, not only lessens maximum loads on the grid but also allows EV owners to capitalize on high electricity prices. Similarly, charging stations can be configured to refill EV batteries with grid power when prices dip. Doing this helps vehicle owners avoid demand charges (additional fees, levied according to the maximum rate at which power is drawn), which can make up about 90 percent of a charging stationâs electric bill.\n4\nStefan Knupfer, Jesse Noffsinger, and Shivika Sahdev, â\nHow battery storage can help charge the electric-vehicle market\n,â February 2018.\nFleets with lower vehicle utilization and reliable charging patterns would be particularly suitable for V2G services. School buses, for example, have predictably low utilization during hours when power demand peaks. Setting EV-recharging patterns to deliver V2G services and minimize demand charges could generate $1.6 billion in cost savings and revenues.\nWe believe that opportunities in EV fleet charging will materialize first in places with high-demand charges and sunny weather, which makes solar-power generation more economical. A favorable policy environment is important, too. Just as policies have aided the growth of the US market for EVs, they could also help the EV fleet-charging market to develop. No fewer than 15 states and territories offer incentives and tax credits for the installation of EV charging stations. (One reason for policy makers to support the development of the fleet-charging sector is that optimized fleet charging could also bring about other outcomes, such as reduced use of energy-intensive thermal âpeakerâ plants, expansion of renewable-generation capacity, and lower emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants.)\nCapturing opportunities in EV fleet charging\nWe believe that companies can best capture the opportunities in the EV fleet-charging market by offering a well-rounded set of services. To do this, four elements will need to be in place:\nHardware and software integration,\nwhich helps fleet operators optimize energy and vehicle use by setting driving schedules and routes, charging intervals, and vehicle maintenance in alignment with customer demand, power prices, traffic conditions, and charging-station availability. Such solutions may need to be customized or developed.\nDigital, analytics, and connectivity\nsupporting activities across the value chain, from data management to customer communications.\nA large base of installed EV chargers\nrunning at high utilization rates.\nAccess to price signals\nfrom the power market, which can help optimize charging by enabling real-time decisions and avoiding peaker-plant energy generation.\nSeveral kinds of companies have begun offering EV fleet-charging services, though they have yet to develop all of the capabilities described above. Solar-power companies have ventured into the business, generally with solutions that target individual vehicle owners rather than fleet operators. A segment of solar companies, solar carport providers, serves commercial and municipal fleets. But few of those offer substantial storage capacity, and their off-grid systems carry high balance-of-system costs (required costs related to hardware, software, and services other than the solar panel or battery).\nUtility companies manage most customer touchpoints and data, so they are well positioned to market new offerings. However, in the United States, about 60 percent of US power demand is found in competitive generation markets, where offering integrated charging services is difficult because power producers and distribution utilities must be separate companies. Makers of EV charging equipment are moving further downstream into energy management and operations, but few of them generate power. Nor do providers of energy-management services.\nCompanies that wish to provide EV fleet operators with charging services will need to look beyond existing business models. It may require an investor or a well-capitalized business to combine multiple entities into one with all the right capabilities, or complementary businesses to join forces in a partnership.\nRob Bland\nis a partner in McKinsey’s Silicon Valley office,\nWenting Gao\nis a consultant in the Houston office,\nJesse Noffsinger\nis an associate partner in the Seattle office, and\nGiulia Siccardo\nis an associate partner in the San Francisco office.\nExplore a career with us\nSearch Openings\nRelated Articles\nArticle\nCharging ahead: Electric-vehicle infrastructure demand\nArticle\nHow battery storage can help charge the electric-vehicle market",

Global sales have risen from tens of thousands of vehicles a decade ago to 6.5 million in 2021, representing an annual compound growth rate of 57%. In China alone, sales have reached 3.52 million units.\nThe development of electric vehicles has accelerated significantly particularly in the past two years. The market penetration rate in Europe has risen from 3.6% of new car sales in 2019, to 14% in the first half of 2021. In China, this penetration rate has reached around 20% in recent months – up from 10% prior to 2021. The American and Japanese EV markets were initially sluggish, but they, too, are picking up speed now. Meanwhile, in the United States, the market penetration rate of new car sales increased from 1.9% in 2019 to 3.2% in the first half of 2021.\nIn light of new zero-carbon energy plans set out by governments and the electrification schedules of the major automobile companies, we anticipate that by 2030 the market penetration rates of electric vehicle sales in the automobile sector will reach 40-50%, and by 2050, almost all fuel vehicles will be replaced by electric vehicles.\nThe momentum these companies are gathering can be seen by their high performances in stock markets. Tesla, the bellwether, has a market value of over USD $1 trillion, which is higher than the combined valuations of Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors, Hyundai Motors, Ford and BMW. Moreover, the combined value of the rising forces in the China’s EV sector: NIO, XPeng and Li Auto, has surpassed USD $100 billion. The market value of the EV battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) has now surpassed that of PetroChina – Asia’s largest oil and gas producer. This is evidence that the era of electric vehicles has arrived, and it brings huge commercial value.\nThe automobile industry traditionally has a long value chain. BMW, for example, has more than 12,000 suppliers located in 70 countries around the world. In terms of downstream sales and services, in China there are approximately 30,000 car dealers and 300,000 repair and maintenance companies, which in total employ a workforce of around 3 million. Hence, the transition to electric vehicles will not only affect traditional car companies themselves, but also deeply affect industry upstream and downstream in the value chain. However, this also opens up new channels of opportunities, five of which will be explored in this article.\n1. The Blowout Growth of the EV Battery Industry\nThe channel that has received the most direct impact from the development of the EV vehicles is the EV battery industry. EV batteries account for approximately 40% of the cost structure of low-end electric vehicles. Batteries are also a determining factor in the vehicle’s performance. The fast development of electric vehicles and their ability to compete with traditional automobile companies has been enabled by declining costs and an increase in performance levels, which itself has been driven by advances in battery technology and economies of scale. In the past 10 years, the industry’s average battery storage capacity has roughly tripled, and costs have declined by 90%.\nThe development of the EV industry has ushered in many opportunities for the EV battery. It is predicted that by 2030, the global battery market will reach 3,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh), which is 20 times larger than in 2020. In addition to battery-manufacturing, a large area of development for battery companies is in energy storage. As energy resources shift to renewables (particularly with the rise of wind and solar power) there will be many opportunities in the energy storage sector. We estimate that by 2030, the global energy storage market will reach 1,000 GWh.\nThe EV battery industry itself also created or developed many smaller industries, such as the mining of nickel, cobalt, lithium and aluminum, the chemical production of phosphorous for lithium iron phosphate batteries (lithium batteries with more efficient charging), separators (which keep battery electrodes separate), liquid electrolytes, equipment manufacturing, battery recycling and other related industries.\nChina’s EV industry is the most competitive in the world. In the last two years, battery exports made up approximately one-half of those worldwide. China also continues to dominate global battery supply chains. In 2021, Chinese companies accounted for 86% of the global market share in the field of anode materials and liquid electrolytes. However, one of the challenges the EV industry in China is facing is its large external dependence on upstream mineral resources. In order to combat this challenge, in the past two years China’s largest EV battery manufacturers, CATL and Gotion High Tech, have built factories overseas. In the future, there will be a few large multinational battery companies, such as these, which will exert a large influence on global supply chains.\n2. Electric Vehicles Enter a New Era of Competition\nThe second channel of opportunity stems from the rise of electric vehicles changing the concept of vehicle manufacturing. In recent years, we have seen Tesla go from an outsider to the biggest player in the industry. We have also seen the rise of Chinese EV companies NIO, XPeng and WM Motor Technology, independently operated brands like Aion, ARCFOX, Voyah and ZEEKR, and new American companies like Lucid and Rivian. We have witnessed technology companies like Huawei cross into the vehicle manufacturing sector. Such fluid business environments would not have been possible in the traditional vehicle manufacturing sector.\nThe structure of the traditional manufacturing sector is very complicated. It has a high technology threshold, strict patent barriers, and a whole range of complex technical and engineering challenges, such as the building of engines, gearboxes, and chassis technology, which are all tied to the vehicle’s safety performance. The combination of these factors creates a very high ‘barrier to entry’ in the industry.\nMoreover, the sales and maintenance model of the industry creates a network effect whereby enterprises can gain competitive advantage through customer loyalty; this makes it difficult for smaller companies to compete. Taking the United States as an example, from the birth of the industry up until the 1970s when Japanese automobile companies entered the U.S. market, the industry was dominated by the ‘big three’: Ford, General Motors and Chrysler, which always held at least 80% of the market share. Before the rise of Tesla, it was very difficult for an outsider to enter the market and achieve success.\nBy replacing engines, gearboxes and fuel tanks with batteries, electric motors and electric control systems, EV companies significantly reduced the complexity of the automobile manufacturing process. Engines in a traditional fuel vehicle would contain at least 2,000 moving parts – with the introduction of the electric vehicle this was reduced to 20. Such a reduction in complexity largely reduced the value of the patents and knowledge that fuel-based vehicle giants had built up over the decades.\nThe lowering of the vehicle manufacturing threshold has had a profound impact on the competitive landscape of the industry. The market stability from the fuel vehicle era is being disrupted and the era of electric vehicles is set to bloom. Although giants in the EV industry have had their share of success in experiencing rapid growth, from 2019 to the first half of 2020, the market share of the top 10 EV companies fell from 63.2% to 56.7%. In this new era, there are opportunities for both newcomers and old forces in automobile manufacturing. The new forces entering the industry often have a digital product mindset, and in their product structure modelling they do not carry any baggage from the past. These companies often have the tenacity and willingness to try new strategies.\nAlthough traditional car manufacturers have been slow in terms of electrification and automation, they have now mostly come to terms with the direction of the automobile industry and have made plans to invest large amounts of resources to carry out this transformation. Volkswagen, for example, plans to invest a total of EURO 159 billion in the next five years, of which 89 billion will be directed towards EV technology and digitalization. By 2030, the number of its purely electrical vehicles will rise to 50%, and by 2040, it will only manufacture electric cars. Toyota has also invested USD $70 billion to electrify its vehicles by 2030, half of which will be invested in developing a battery electric vehicle line-up.\nThe lowering of the entry threshold has given Chinese EV companies a historic opportunity to overtake other manufacturers. Due to the government’s support for the sector, several companies have been able to gain a first-mover advantage. Currently, China has the largest EV market in the world and the most complete battery supply chain. Internet giants like Huawei and Baidu are also providing intelligent infrastructure for the industry. The combination of these advantages suggests a bright future for the industry in China.\n3. Developments in Software and Digitalization will be a Major Trend\nThe third channel of opportunity is the trend towards digitalization and software advancements. In the 1970s, only 3.6% of a vehicle’s cost included these elements, however, in 2020 they made up 35%. In comparison to the complex mechanics of fuel vehicles, electric vehicles have batteries, electric motors and electric control systems which all simplify the control of the vehicle: they make signal transmission more convenient, and the control of voltage and current more sensitive. The result is that such cars are more suitable than fuel-based cars for the development of electronics and software.\nIn an electric vehicle, the most fundamental aspect of the vehicle’s architecture is the control system, the autonomous driving system, and the smart cockpit system. The control system is responsible for the operation of the chassis, braking, vehicle safety, and directing the car to carry out basic driving functions. The autonomous driving and smart cockpit systems are more focused on interactions between the vehicle and the operating environment, as well as those between the person and the vehicle. All these systems rely on chips, software, and algorithms to carry out their functions.\nIn terms of electronic hardware, EVs have been built as a “computer”. Taking Huawei’s automotive product planning as an example, one electric vehicle requires various kinds of chips: the Kirin 9000 (an SEO chip), the Ascend 310 (an AI chip), the Kunpeng 920 (a CPU chip) and Balong 5G01 (a 5G chip), as well as various microcontrollers – small microcomputers all contained on a single chip. Moreover, these various chips carry out functions in a vehicle related to driving, control, and entertainment. One of the most important uses for these chips is to process the vast amounts of data collected by the increasing number of cameras which are being deployed on electric vehicles. For example, when NIO released its new ET7 model in 2021, in addition to fitting four NVDIA Orin SoC chips inside its autonomous driving controller, it also installed a high-resolution LiDAR, a 5-millimeter wave radar, 12 ultrasonic sensors and 11 HD cameras.\nIn the future, it is estimated that for level 4 autonomous driving, a vehicle will need to process 4.8 billion bytes of data per second – this is equivalent to the computing power of nine iPhones. This means there is huge opportunity in the hardware market. By 2030, the automotive chip market is expected to grow to USD $115 billion, which will account for 11% of the entire chip market.\nElectric cars are very much software-based products. Automotive chips provide the computing power, but software and algorithms are needed to enable this power. In some modern and high-end electric vehicles, the software can be comprised of up to 100 million lines of code. In comparison, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner jet only uses 6.5 million lines of code and its F35 jet only 24 million. As vehicles become more intelligent and automated, control systems will need to improve their response time and control capabilities, automated driving systems will need to improve the accuracy and security of their algorithms, and the intelligent cockpit system will need to support more diverse applications and services. With electric vehicles becoming increasingly based on software, many technology companies, already possessing strong software divisions, have successfully been able to move into the electric vehicle sector. Software is also the biggest shortcoming of traditional automobile manufacturers and represents a challenge they may face in their electric transformation.\n4. The Maturation of Autonomous Driving\nThe fourth area of opportunity is the move toward autonomous driving: an important step in the evolution of electric vehicles that is going to bring about major changes to transportation. “Driving” requires a large amount of manpower, cost, and time. In China, there are approximately 410 million people who hold a driving license; suppose it takes 100 hours for every person to learn how to drive, in total 460 years would be spent on this process. Moreover, supposing that the average driving license holder spends 50 hours every year on the wheel, according to the most recent calculations of the average salary in China, that would be equal to an output loss of RMB 860 billion (USD $135 billion).\nIn China, there is a lot of manpower being invested in the driving profession. There are approximately 3 million taxi drivers, 30 million registered online ride-hailing drivers and 30 million truck drivers. In the logistics sector, drivers account for 10% of the cost of the entire chain. Such data points to the fact that social costs would be significantly reduced if driving were to be automated.\nAccording to recent estimates, based on a 5-year operation cycle, the cost of operating a self-driving taxi can be reduced by RMB 330,000 (USD $51,835) compared to running a ride-hailing taxi. Another analysis revealed that in the United States, a 10% autonomous driving penetration rate would save USD $37.7 billion in social costs every year. If 90% of all cars were autonomous, the U.S. would save USD $447.1 billion annually.\nSelf-driving vehicles not only save a large amount of labor cost, they also greatly improve social capital and traffic efficiency, improving congestion and lowering collision frequency. In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla’s Autopilot ADV technology participated in a test that found the car was involved in a collision every 8 million kilometers. In the same period, the average distance for a vehicle in the United States to be involved in a collision was 780,000 kilometers, thereby indicating safety is increased by 10 times in self-driving vehicles. In addition, as the technology of autonomous driving develops further, it is expected that they will become increasingly safer.\nAccording to recent predictions, global exports of autonomous vehicles that are at level 3 or above will increase from 32,000 vehicles in 2020 to 863,000 in 2024 (a 128% increase on an annualized basis). Autonomous driving has already begun to be applied in various modes of transport, such as in taxis, delivery vehicles and long-distance cargo transportation. Many Chinese companies have piloted driverless taxi services, such as Baidu, Antu, Didi, WeRide and Pony.ai.\n5. The Radical Changes in the Automotive Ecosystem\nThe final channel of change and opportunity is the impact which the development of electric vehicles is having on the automotive ecosystem. Upstream energy supply is changing from oil to electricity, and the means to supplement this energy is changing from refueling to charging and battery swapping. This transition is itself creating new industries, such as EV charging piles, battery swapping stations and battery recycling. There is also a transformation underway in the sales and service industries downstream.\nAs the most used method of EV supplementation, charging piles have been continually increasing in recent years. At the end of 2021, there was a total of 2.6 million in China, with a compound growth rate of 65.3% in the past five years. The ratio of EV charging piles to EV’s has also reduced in China from 7.8:1 in 2015 to 3:1 in 2021. As the EV market penetration increases and the EV charger to EV ratio decreases, it is expected that by 2025 the EV charging pile market will reach RMB 250 billion (USD $39 billion). Charging technology is also constantly developing. According to the plans of major EV companies, by 2025 800v fast charging will be implemented, which will have the potential to rival the time it takes to refill a traditional fuel vehicle.\nFurthermore, the number of battery swapping stations in China is growing exponentially. At the end of 2021, there were 1298 stations (of which 777 were owned by NIO), increasing year-over-year by 134%. Due to the relatively long time it takes to charge an EV at an electric pile at their current stage of technological development, as well as the strain they cause to land resources and the grid, battery swapping has become a viable and convenient alternative. Moreover, the introduction of battery leasing services has heavily reduced the initial purchasing costs of electric cars.\nThe battery market is expected to increase rapidly, particularly as companies like NIO, BAIC Group and Dongfeng decide on their future OEM models, and EV battery companies like CATL release their plans for standardization. Many institutions estimate that battery swapping stations will increase to 20,000 by 2025, and that the market could reach RMB 260 billion (USD $40.8 billion).\nA battery life is usually 5-8 years. After recycling the battery, the retired battery material can be recovered to be re-used. As electric vehicles become more popular in the future there will likely be a surge in battery retirement, which will make the battery recycling industry increasingly important. According to agency forecasts, there were 200,000 retried batteries in 2020, which by 2025, is expected to increase to 780,000. As of September 2021, there were 171 battery recycling enterprises in China, with 9,985 battery recycling sites established across various regions. In China, there are also many electric vehicle companies that have set up integrated recycling plants, such as CATL and Gotian High Tech.\nThe development of electric vehicles has also made great changes in vehicle sales and service markets. Electrification has greatly reduced the number of parts required to manufacture the vehicles – which in turn has lowered demand for repair and maintenance. The number of parts required to manufacture a fuel vehicle is as high as 100,000, with 10,000 parts needed for the motor alone. There are only 10,000 parts in total in an electric vehicle -one-tenth of the amount in fuel vehicles.\nSince oil does not need to be replaced and the motor managed, mechanical component failures are far less common, which reduces the need for the vehicle to be serviced. According to estimates, after-sales maintenance costs for electric vehicles will be reduced by as much as 40% compared with fuel vehicles of the same age. Traditional car dealers received 60% of their profits from repair services – clearly in the automotive aftermarket, electric vehicles are going to disrupt traditional business models and force companies to adjust.\nAutomation and software advancements are changing the way vehicles are maintained and upgraded. Performance optimizations and bug fixes can now be carried out by remote software over-the-air (OTA) updates. A typical example is the problem of long breaking distance after Tesla’s release of its Model 3. Traditionally, this kind of problem would have been solved by a large-scale recall or sending it to a dealer to replace the parts. In Tesla’s case, their engineers upgraded the braking system via OTA programming in several days, reducing the breaking distance by six meters and greatly improving the vehicle’s safety. Therefore, it is evident that the new forces in electric vehicle manufacturing are more equipped to facilitate sales and servicing networks. As traditional car manufacturers electrify their vehicles, it will be of utmost importance for them to optimize their sales and servicing models.\nThe EV revolution that is underway is a global historic shift that could be compared to the Internet revolution. It is a revolution that has the potential to solve challenges that are affecting the survival and development of humankind, such as climate change.\nThe development of electric vehicles has greatly impacted related industries, opening up new channels and opportunities. It will create an upstream EV battery industry; it will change the competitive landscape and models of traditional enterprises, both in vehicle manufacturing and the automobile aftermarket; and it will promote other channels, such as digitalization, software advancement and automation. The development of electric vehicles and the influence which these channels will have in the next ten years on the global economy will be huge. It is also a means for the world to achieve its carbon neutrality goals. Lastly, it is a major opportunity for Chinese companies in the automobile sector and related industries to have a global influence and impact people’s daily lives.\nShare\nEnjoying what you’re reading?\nSign up to our monthly newsletter to get more China insights delivered to your inbox.\nProfessor profile\nLIU Jing\nProfessor of Accounting and Finance and Director of Investment Research Center, Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business (CKGSB)\nPhD, Columbia University\nLearn more\nRelated Articles\nDigitalization and Technology\nReinventing Work and Education\n07 September 2023\nDigitalization and Technology\nIf anything can shift Business Schools, it will be AI\n07 September 2023\nEconomics and Finance\nDigital Trends to Transform Your Business\n29 September 2022\nRelated Articles\nDigitalization and Technology\nQuality Time\n20 December 2023\nDigitalization and Technology\nFuture Intelligence\n13 December 2023\nDigitalization and Technology\nCryptic Crypto\n12 December 2023\nDigitalization and Technology\nUnexpected Item in the Bagging Area\n11 December 2023\nOur Programs\nFrontiers in Digital Innovation: AI, Future of Tech & Data Science\nGlobal Unicorn Program Series\nThis program offers you the opportunity to master AI algorithms and data analytics, navigate future technology landscapes, and embrace cross-cultural perspectives.\nLocation\nColumbia University, USA\nDate\nMay 20-24, 2024\nLanguage\nEnglish\nLearn more\nThe Biotech Accelerator Unicorn Program\nGlobal Unicorn Program Series\nThis program equips CEOs and founders in the life sciences and biotechnology industry with the essential knowledge and connections needed to thrive in this rapidly evolving sector.\nLocation\nUniversity of California, San Diego, USA\nDate\nSeptember 9-13, 2024\nLanguage\nEnglish\nLearn more\nEmerging Tech Management Week: Silicon Valley\nThis program offers insights into emerging technology developments and the skills required to innovate, grow, and transform your business strategy.\nLocation\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, USA\nDate\nNovember 3-8, 2024\nLanguage\nEnglish\nLearn more\nUnderstand China from the inside\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter today!\nCKGSB Knowledge Magazine\nCKGSB Newsletter\nSubscribe\n© CKGSB.

Adjusted Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\")\n\"EBITDA\" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. \"Adjusted Net Los\"s is defined as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. \"Adjusted EPS\" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures.\nCANOO INC.\nNON GAAP RECONCILIATION TABLE\n(in thousands)\nThese non-GAAP financial measures, when presented, are reconciled to the most closely comparable U.S. GAAP measure as disclosed below for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n2023\n2022\nEBITDA\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nAdjusted\nNet Loss\nEBITDA\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nAdjusted\nNet Loss\nNet loss\n$    (70,870)\n$      (70,870)\n$     (70,870)\n$  (164,392)\n$ (164,392)\n$    (164,392)\nInterest expense (income)\n2,264\n2,264\n—\n(19)\n(19)\n—\nProvision for income taxes\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nDepreciation\n4,562\n4,562\n—\n2,892\n2,892\n—\nGain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability\n—\n(59)\n(59)\n—\n(9,471)\n(9,471)\nGain on fair value change in warrant and derivative liability\n—\n(5,623)\n(5,623)\n—\n—\n—\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n949\n949\n—\n—\n—\nOther income (expense), net\n—\n(226)\n(226)\n—\n378\n378\nStock-based compensation\n—\n6,707\n6,707\n—\n20,773\n20,773\nAdjusted Non-GAAP amount\n(64,044)\n(62,296)\n(69,122)\n(161,519)\n(149,839)\n(152,712)\nUS GAAP net loss per share\nBasic\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.14)\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.68)\nDiluted\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.14)\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.68)\nAdjusted Non-GAAP net loss per share (Adjusted EPS):\nBasic\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.14)\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.63)\nDiluted\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.14)\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.63)\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\nN/A\nN/A\n505,576\nN/A\nN/A\n242,772\nDiluted\nN/A\nN/A\n505,576\nN/A\nN/A\n242,772\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2023\n2022\nEBITDA\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nAdjusted\nNet Loss\nEBITDA\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nAdjusted\nNet Loss\nNet loss\n$  (161,602)\n$    (161,602)\n$   (161,602)\n$  (289,757)\n$ (289,757)\n$    (289,757)\nInterest expense (income)\n2,560\n2,560\n—\n9\n9\n—\nProvision for income taxes\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nDepreciation\n9,137\n9,137\n—\n5,570\n5,570\n—\nGain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability\n—\n(2,564)\n(2,564)\n—\n(24,936)\n(24,936)\nGain on fair value change in warrant and derivative liability\n—\n(22,965)\n(22,965)\n—\n—\n—\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n27,688\n27,688\n—\n—\n—\nOther income (expense), net\n—\n1,790\n1,790\n—\n395\n395\nStock-based compensation\n—\n16,543\n16,543\n—\n41,453\n41,453\nAdjusted Non-GAAP amount\n(149,905)\n(129,413)\n(141,110)\n(284,178)\n(267,266)\n(272,845)\nUS GAAP net loss per share\nBasic\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.35)\nN/A\nN/A\n(1.22)\nDiluted\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.35)\nN/A\nN/A\n(1.22)\nAdjusted Non-GAAP net loss per share (Adjusted EPS):\nBasic\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.31)\nN/A\nN/A\n(1.15)\nDiluted\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.31)\nN/A\nN/A\n(1.15)\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\nN/A\nN/A\n462,303\nN/A\nN/A\n$     238,242\nDiluted\nN/A\nN/A\n462,303\nN/A\nN/A\n$     238,242\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information in this press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"forecast,\" \"intend,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"seek,\" \"target\" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding access to capital, estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and the achievement of operational milestones, including the ability to meet and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities, current or anticipated customer orders, and expectations regarding the development of facilities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at\nwww.sec.gov\n. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.\nView original content to download multimedia:\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canoo-inc-announces-second-quarter-2023-results-301900170.html\nSOURCE Canoo\nReleased August 14, 2023\nEmail Alerts\nTear Sheet\nContacts\nRSS News Feed\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nInvestors\nPrivacy & Legal\nFAQ",

Measures\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n\"EBITDA\" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.\nCANOO INC.\nADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION TABLE\n(in thousands)\nThe following table reconciles net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\nNet loss\n$            (80,231)\n$         (138,112)\n$         (487,694)\n$         (346,768)\nInterest expense (income)\n(60)\n(24)\n2,249\n(103)\nDepreciation\n2,534\n2,604\n11,554\n8,921\nEBITDA\n(77,757)\n(135,532)\n(473,891)\n(337,950)\nAdjustments:\nGain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability\n(3,175)\n(3,280)\n(26,044)\n(104,446)\nLoss on fair value change in private placement warrants liability\n—\n—\n—\n1,639\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n531\n—\n4,626\n—\nOther (expense) income, net\n(358)\n(64)\n62\n(224)\nStock-based compensation\n18,593\n18,602\n79,573\n108,360\nSEC settlement (Note 12)\n1,500\n—\n1,500\n—\nNon-cash legal settlement (Note 12)\n—\n—\n5,532\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(60,666)\n(120,274)\n(408,642)\n(332,621)\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information in this press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"forecast,\" \"intend,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"seek,\" \"target\" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding access to capital, estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and the achievement of operational milestones, including the ability to meet and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities, current or anticipated customer orders, and expectations regarding the development of facilities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at\nwww.sec.gov\n. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.\nSOURCE Canoo\n×\nModal title\nAlso from this source\nCanoo to Announce Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results\nCanoo (Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech advanced mobility company, today announced that it will report its financial results for the quarter ended...\nCanoo has entered into a $45 million Convertible Preferred Stock purchase agreement by a foreign strategic institutional investor with the potential for upsizing to $150 million\nCanoo (NASDAQ: GOEV), a leading high-tech advanced mobility company, announced today that it has entered into a purchase agreement with a foreign...\nMore Releases From This Source\nExplore\nAutomotive\nTransportation, Trucking & Railroad\nBanking & Financial Services\nEarnings Forecasts & Projections\nNews Releases in Similar Topics\nSign up for Top Stories & curated News\ndelivered to your inbox\nEnter Your Email\nSelect Country\nSelect Country\nSubmit\nThank you for\nsubscribing!\nBy signing up you agree to receive content from us.\nOur newsletters contain tracking pixels to help us deliver unique content based on each subscriber's engagement and interests.

(Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech advanced mobility company, today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2023.\n\"Medium to long term demand for zero emission, technology driven vehicles will continue to grow rapidly as the average age of vehicle has reached an all-time high between 12 to 14 years depending on the segment. These numbers prove that the stage is set for zero emission, technology driven vehicles especially in the TAM's and the geographies we are focused on where there is current demand and high-volume buyers. We also believe that we are focused on the geographies and segments where there is available capital and favorable regulatory conditions,\" said Tony Aquila, Chairman and CEO at Canoo.\nFirst Quarter & Recent Business Updates:\nRaised over $150 million in on and off balance sheet financing\nBattery module manufacturing system delivered at Pryor facility\nInitial installation of general assembly line at Oklahoma City facility\n5% Q-o-Q growth in stage 2 and 3 orders\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights:\nAs of March 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.7 million. After giving effect to the issuance and sale by the Company of convertible debentures of $48.0 million and exercise of warrants of $15.0 million on April 25, 2023, our cash balance would have been $69.7 million as of March 31,2023.\nGAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $90.7 million for the three March 31, 2023, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $125.4 million for the three March 31, 2022. The GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included a gain of $2.5 million on the fair value change of the contingent earnout shares liability.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $(67.1) million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $(117.4) million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\nAdjusted Net Loss of $72.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $120.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\nGAAP Net Loss per share of $(0.22) for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $(0.54) for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\nAdjusted EPS of $(0.17) for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $(0.51) for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled $67.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $120.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $18.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $2.0 million net cash provided by investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2022.\nSecond Quarter 2023 Business Outlook\nBased upon our current projections, Canoo expects:\nOperating Expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation) of: $40 million to $60 million\nCapital Expenditures of: $10 million to $20 million\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call Information\nCanoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, May 15, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.\nTo listen to the conference call via telephone dial (877) 407-9169 (U.S.) and (201) 493-6755 (international callers/U.S. toll) and enter the conference ID number 13738439.

Adjusted Net Loss is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures.\nCANOO INC.\nNON GAAP RECONCILIATION TABLE (in thousands)\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most closely comparable U.S. GAAP measure below:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2023\n2022\nEBITDA\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nAdjusted\nNet Loss\nEBITDA\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nAdjusted\nNet Loss\nNet loss\n$\n(90,732)\n(90,732)\n(90,732)\n$ (125,367)\n$ (125,367)\n$\n(125,367)\nInterest expense (income)\n296\n296\n—\n29\n29\n—\nProvision for income taxes\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nDepreciation\n4,575\n4,575\n—\n2,678\n2,678\n—\nGain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability\n—\n(2,505)\n(2,505)\n—\n(15,465)\n(15,465)\nGain on fair value change in warrants liability\n—\n(17,342)\n(17,342)\n—\n—\n—\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n26,739\n26,739\n—\n—\n—\nOther expense (income), net\n—\n2,016\n2,016\n—\n17\n17\nStock-based compensation\n—\n9,836\n9,836\n—\n20,680\n20,680\nAdjusted Non-GAAP amount\n(85,861)\n(67,117)\n(71,988)\n(122,660)\n(117,428)\n(120,135)\nUS GAAP net loss per share\nBasic\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.22)\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.54)\nDiluted\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.22)\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.54)\nAdjusted Non-GAAP net loss per share (Adjusted EPS):\nBasic\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.17)\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.51)\nDiluted\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.17)\nN/A\nN/A\n(0.51)\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\nN/A\nN/A\n418,064\nN/A\nN/A\n$\n233,661\nDiluted\nN/A\nN/A\n418,064\nN/A\nN/A\n$\n233,661\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information in this press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding access to capital, estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and the achievement of operational milestones, including the ability to meet and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities, current or anticipated customer orders, and expectations regarding the development of facilities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at\nwww.sec.gov\n.

Zeeba will add Canoo Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV) to its long-term fleet leasing portfolio.\n“We have a large committed, growing order book, are finalizing our multi-year allocations for 2023 customer deliveries and will share our manufacturing plan with the broader market shortly,” said Tony Aquila, Chairman & CEO at Canoo. “This order is another milestone validating our product and strategy. Small & medium sized business (SMB) are the backbone of our communities, employing about half of all working Americans¹ and they are Zeeba's target customers. We put technology first and combined class leading ergonomics, a small vehicle footprint-to-cargo ratio and platform versatility while achieving a lower carbon footprint and higher return on investment for the operator, all of which will help SMBs compete.”\nCanoo vehicles: Modular and engineered for industry leading ROI\nCanoo vehicles are American-made Class 1 commercial electric vehicles built on the company’s proprietary multi-purpose platform (MPP) architecture that integrates all critical components. Most of service, maintenance and updates will be done over the air, which decreases vehicle downtime.\nDesigned and engineered with the driver in mind, Canoo vehicles feature a panoramic front window to improve road visibility and utilize true steer by wire technology, resulting in more usable interior space and better driver ergonomics. Feedback from our recent real-world deliveries confirmed the superior user experience, based on ride, in-cabin comfort, road visibility and maneuverability, as well as unprecedented user ergonomics.\nThe LDV combines 120 cubic feet of cargo volume with an 80kw battery pack with the handling and turning radius of a small passenger vehicle, making it a safer and more familiar experience for drivers. The LV is a people and goods mover with passenger seating configuration and the same battery pack, visibility and handling characteristics as the LDV due to its common platform.\nTech Enabled and Flexible Fleet Solutions for Small & Medium Business\nZeeba provides flexible and affordable fleet solutions so SMBs can focus on their products and customers and not worry about mobility. The Canoo LDV and LV modular design enables Zeeba to provide client-specific configurations that can be upfit to different use cases over the vehicle lifecycle.\n“We are thrilled to be able to deliver Canoo vehicles to our customers in the near future. We are focused on offering the most advanced fleet solutions and have recognized Canoo’s vehicles as leaders in technology driven sustainable mobility. We also wanted to secure EV vehicle supply for years to come,” said Kayvon Marashi, Chief Executive Officer for Zeeba Automotive Group, Inc.\nZeeba provides a tailored approach to customers to help them efficiently and effectively operate their business and plans to achieve a minimum 50% electrification by Q1 of 2024.\n“The LDV & LV are going to be a game changer for businesses we serve. Canoo technology will allow our SMB customers to effectively and efficiently operate their businesses while reducing their carbon footprint. Zeeba has very ambitious electrification goals and we want to achieve leadership in fleet technology,” said Mike Paletz, Chief Strategy Officer at Zeeba.\nZeeba will deploy Canoo LDVs & LVs to their SMB customers who look for customizable options when configuring their fleet, meeting their sustainability goals and benefitting from competitive operating cost.  The LDV & LV will be used by customers in the last mile delivery space, mobile goods, ride hailing, food delivery, trade professions and more.\nAbout Canoo\nCanoo’s mission is to bring EVs to Everyone.

For this video, Canoo transformed its skateboard into a cabin-less “skatekart” and professional racing driver,\nSara Price\n, tested the performance of the platform, which will serve as the backbone of all Canoo vehicles.\n“I was blown away by how fun it was to drive,” said Price. “The overall performance was impressive. The skateboard felt powerful, with smooth and dynamic handling, especially during high speed cornering. The drive-by-wire steering was something new for me and it felt like it was built for the track.”\nHigh-Performance Powertrain\nCanoo developed a complete set of proprietary high-performance powertrain systems ideally suited for its modular skateboard platform. The powertrain systems were specifically developed entirely in-house to offer class competitive performance across its full range of vehicles. The skateboard supports dual, front or rear motor configurations, and is capable of achieving up to 500 horsepower and over 300 miles of range with dual motors. The rear primary unit is designed to deliver a maximum 300 horsepower and 450 Newton meters of torque, and the front unit is designed to deliver a maximum of 200 horsepower and 320 Newton meters of torque. Efficiency of the motors is designed to peak at 97% which is optimized for urban driving environments.\nUnlocking Potential with Steer-by-Wire\nCanoo’s skateboard platform includes the industry’s first true steer-by-wire system, which was inspired by performance race cars, to provide a highly responsive driving experience and versatility for Canoo’s future line up.\nThanks to steer-by-wire, eliminating the mechanical steering connections between the cabin and skateboard, Canoo is able to demonstrate for the first time how the steering wheel can be moved to suit any cabin design or driver positioning. This versatility is well suited to accommodate full autonomy once commercially available, as well as for right hand drive and Canoo’s future delivery vehicles.\nThe variable ratio, speed sensitive by-wire electronic power steering also introduces an opportunity to leverage software to customize the driving experience depending on user preferences and use cases, for example, by changing the lock-to-lock ratio to provide more precision driving.\nIndependent Skateboard, Flexible Use\nUnlike other platforms on the market, Canoo’s skateboard is uniquely modular, offering a truly self-contained, fully functional rolling chassis, so much so that it can be driven entirely independently. The skateboard architecture directly houses all of the most critical components of an electric vehicle, including its industry leading steer-by-wire platform, a transverse composite leaf spring suspension system, an advanced fully electric drivetrain, a proprietary battery compartment and battery thermal management systems, power electronics, vehicle controls, crash absorption structures and autonomous driving components, among others. Each of these component systems has been engineered for optimal performance and efficient packaging into Canoo’s compact platform, with a strong emphasis given to functional integration.\n“We wanted to showcase our skateboard’s performance and prove that our rolling chassis is a truly self-contained unit with everything needed to drive built inside,” said Ulrich Kranz, In Charge of Canoo. “We have revolutionized the platform design concept with a chassis that can be easily married with different cabins, with little adjustment, enabling us to get new vehicles on the road faster and cheaper. By keeping the most critical and expensive part of the vehicle uniform in all our models, it allows us to rapidly and cost effectively bring to market a full line-up of EVs.”\nCanoo’s core technological backbone is its skateboard vehicle platform that is common to all its vehicles. By utilizing a common platform, Canoo will be able to rapidly scale subsequent vehicle programs at a significantly lower capital cost because it reduces expenses in research and development, testing and manufacturing. Canoo’s skateboard provides a significant advancement in automotive technology. With the company’s skateboard, along with an efficient design and proprietary production process, Canoo anticipates new vehicle models can be developed in as little as 18-24 months, significantly faster than the average estimated timeframe across the automotive industry.\nThe dimensions of Canoo’s skateboard were deliberately selected to suit the needs of more than 75% of the most common passenger and light duty commercial vehicles on the road today.\nWorld’s Flattest Electric Vehicle Platform\nCanoo has developed the world’s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example,\nthe canoo\n, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car.\nTo help achieve this, Canoo’s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires.\nVideo Credits\nCanoo’s in-house design team worked with\nPorch House\nto create the film which was shot in California’s\nRabbit Dry Lake\n. The piece is directed by\nCody Autterson,\nproduced by\nAndrew Schneider\nwith\nJared Fadel\nas the Director of Photography. Still photography is by\nJack Schroeder\nand\nJenna Norman\ncaptured the behind the scenes photos.\nWhat’s Next for Canoo\nCanoo expects to introduce\nthe canoo\nin 2022, followed by a series of delivery vehicles set to launch in 2023 and a sport vehicle to come thereafter.\nAbout Canoo\nCanoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, reinventing the automotive landscape with bold innovations in design, pioneering technologies, and a unique business model that defies traditional ownership to put customers first. Distinguished by its experienced team – numbering nearly 300 employees from leading technology and automotive companies – Canoo has designed a modular skateboard platform purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. Canoo expects to launch its first consumer model in 2022, simply named the canoo and available only by subscription, followed shortly after by a last-mile delivery vehicle and a sport vehicle, each built off of the same underlying skateboard platform.\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.canoo.com\n.\nFor Canoo press materials, including photos, please visit\npress.canoo.com\n.\nFor investors, please visit\ninvestors.canoo.com\n.\nContacts\nFor Canoo / Media Relations\npress@canoo.com\nNews Release\n,\n2020\ntsz ho ip\nSeptember 24, 2020\nFacebook\n0\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n0\n0\nLikes\nPrevious\nElectric Vehicle Company Canoo Announces Appointment Of Tony Aquila As Executive Chairman\nNews Release, 2020\ntsz ho ip\nOctober 20, 2020\nNext\nElectric Vehicle Company Canoo To List On Nasdaq Through Merger With Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV\nNews Release, 2020\ntsz ho ip\nAugust 18, 2020\nCANOO.COM\nINVESTORS\nPRIVACY & LEGAL\nPrivacy\nTerms of Use\nContact\nPowered by\nSquarespace",
