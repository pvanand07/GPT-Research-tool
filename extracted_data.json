The company also plans to produce\ncommercial electric vehicles\nsuch as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services.\n[4]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nCanoo was founded in 2017 under the name\nEvelozcity\nby Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for\nDeutsche Bank\nas its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for\nBMW\nas a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company\nFaraday Future\nbefore leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became\nchief technology officer\n.\n[5]\nThe company received its primary funding from Chinese investor\nLi \"David\" Pak-Tam/Botan\nand German entrepreneur David Stern.\n[6]\n[7]\nIn April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of\nOpel\nas a senior executive.\n[8]\nIn March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo.\n[9]\nIn July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company.\n[10]\nCanoo Lifestyle Vehicles\n, all-electric\nminivans\nMain articles:\nCanoo LV\nand\nCanoo MPDV\nIn September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the\nCanoo Lifestyle Vehicle\n.\n[11]\nIn February 2020,\nHyundai Motor Group\n, the parent company of\nHyundai Motors\nand\nKia Motors\n, announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's\nStrategy 2025\nprogram which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020.\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\nIn July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure.\n[15]\n[16]\nIn July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program\nJay Leno's Garage\n.\n[17]\nIn September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the\nspecial-purpose acquisition company\nHennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the\nNASDAQ\nvalued at $2.4 billion.\n[18]\nThe expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.\n[19]\n[20]\nOn December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.\n[21]\nA few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its\nMPDV\n(Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.\n[22]\nIn mid-January 2021,\nThe Verge\nreported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with\nApple\nfor a potential role in its secretive\nTitan car project\n.\n[23]\n[24]\nIn May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.\n[25]\nIt was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.\n[26]\nIn December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,\n[27]\n[28]\ncompeting EV startup Harbinger Motors.\n[29]\nCorporate changes\n[\nedit\n]\nOn March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the\nCanoo Pickup Truck\n, an electric\npickup\nset to release in 2023.\n[30]\n[31]\nCanoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque.\n[30]\nThe company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity.\n[30]\nAfter the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.\n[31]\nIt was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.\n[32]\nOn April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman\nTony Aquila\nas CEO.\n[33]\nAlso in April 2021, the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\nlaunched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.\n[34]\nOn June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in\nPryor, Oklahoma\n(just outside\nTulsa\n) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.\n[35]\n[36]\nThe plant will be used to build \"pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023.\"\n[36]\nThe same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company\nVDL Nedcar\nwould start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.\n[37]\nLater in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.\n[38]\nOn November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to\nBentonville, Arkansas\nand establish a manufacturing plant there.\n[39]\nAs of December 2022\n[update]\nthe company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.\n[1]\n[40]\nIn January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an \"advanced industrialization facility\" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.\n[41]\nIn August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production.\nFollowing receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the\nMidAmerica Industrial Park\n(MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.\n[42]\nThis was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.\n[43]\nIn late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.\n[44]\nIn April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a\nUnited States Department of Defense\ncontract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.\n[45]\nThe Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by\nTerex\n.\n[46]\nFirm orders\n[\nedit\n]\nOn April 13, 2022,\nNASA\nselected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its\nArtemis program\n, with a total contract value of $147,855.\n[47]\n[48]\nIn July 2022,\nWalmart\nentered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.\n[49]\nUnder the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.\n[50]\nCanoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in\nGreater Los Angeles\n, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.\n[51]\n[52]\n[53]\nSome days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.\n[54]\n[55]\nKingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.\n[56]\nIn January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.\n[57]\n[58]\n[59]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\n\"Canoo Investor Relations\"\n.\ninvestors.canoo.com\n.

The Asia-Pacific region dominated the global EV market with a share of 50.97% in 2022.\nThe environmental impact of conventional gasoline vehicles and the rise in fuel prices have paved the way for alternative fuel vehicles in the market. Buyers are gradually getting inclined to use battery-powered or hybrid automobiles, which is anticipated to drive the EV market. In recent years, the demand for BEVs has increased considerably among consumers because these vehicles do not use traditional fuels, such as gasoline or diesel. The maintenance cost of EVs is also considerably less, which gives it an advantage over conventional fuel-based vehicles.\nAll models use one or more electric motors for propulsion. Electricity is the main energy source for EVs. There is no internal combustion engine installed in them. A sudden rise in the market’s CAGR can be attributed to the robust demand for\nalternative fuel vehicles\n. Fossil fuel-based vehicles are one of the main causes of air pollution across the world.

The growth of the Electric Vehicles (EV) market has been significant despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting supply chain bottlenecks. Despite these recent challenges and rising production costs as a result of increasing raw material prices, EV sales are still going up at a fast rate. If this continues, they are set to surpass the sales of conventionally propelled vehicles (i.e., vehicles with internal combustion engines) . Compared to 2020, sales of new electric vehicles more than doubled in 2021 with an increase of 108%. This brought EV sales to about 5% of global passenger car sales in 2021.\nChina conveniently topped the global sales charts in 2021 with more electric vehicles sold than the rest of the world combined and almost five times more than Germany, which was in second place. Factors responsible for the Chinese market’s exponential growth include, but are not limited to, the Chinese government’s electric vehicle subsidies, an increasing range of mini electric vehicles, and more affordable brands coming onto the market. Overall, Europe recorded an increase between 2020 and 2021, reaching about 66%, with the plug-in hybrid share of all electric vehicle sales being the biggest in the world. Driven by the availability of more models, as well as the market expansion and purchase incentives, the European market is expected to continue along this trend as countries within the EU\nadopt stricter CO2 emission standards and move toward zero-emissions vehicle mandates.\nRegardless of the tremendous growth in the Electric Vehicles market, it is only limited to a part of the world. As the race to full electrification continues, China , Europe, and the U.S. account for about 95% of the global electric vehicle sales, whereas the rest of the world seems to struggle with catching up. In addition to government subsidies just getting introduced or still being nonexistent, the top reasons cited for the slow progress experienced in those parts of the world include the lack of public charging infrastructure and the premium prices of electric vehicles in these regions.\nOverview\nUnit Sales\nUnits\nAnalyst Opinion\nRevenue\nPrice\nGlobal Comparison\nKey Market Indicators\nPlease wait\nContact\nGet in touch with us.

This explosive growth means electric cars’ share of the overall car market has risen from around 4% in 2020 to 14% in 2022 and is set to increase further to 18% this year, based on the latest IEA projections.\n“Electric vehicles are one of the driving forces in the new global energy economy that is rapidly emerging – and they are bringing about a historic transformation of the car manufacturing industry worldwide,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “The trends we are witnessing have significant implications for global oil demand. The internal combustion engine has gone unrivalled for over a century, but electric vehicles are changing the status quo. By 2030, they will avoid the need for at least 5 million barrels a day of oil. Cars are just the first wave: electric buses and trucks will follow soon.”\nThe overwhelming majority of electric car sales to date are mainly concentrated in three markets – China, Europe and the United States. China is the frontrunner, with 60% of global electric car sales taking place there in 2022. Today, more than half of all electric cars on the road worldwide are in China. Europe and the United States, the second and third largest markets, both saw strong growth with sales increasing 15% and 55% respectively in 2022.\nAmbitious policy programmes in major economies, such as the Fit for 55 package in the European Union and the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States, are expected to further increase market share for electric vehicles this decade and beyond. By 2030, the average share of electric cars in total sales across China, the EU and the United States is set to rise to around 60%.\nThe encouraging trends are also having positive knock-on effects for battery production and supply chains. The new report highlights that announced battery manufacturing projects would be more than enough to meet demand for electric vehicles to 2030 in the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. However, manufacturing remains highly concentrated, with China dominating the battery and component trade – and increasing its share of global electric car exports to more than 35% last year.\nOther economies have announced policies to foster domestic industries that will improve their competitiveness in the EV market in years to come. The EU’s Net Zero Industry Act aims for nearly 90% of annual battery demand to be met by domestic battery manufacturers. Similarly, the US Inflation Reduction Act places emphasis on strengthening domestic supply chains for EVs, batteries and minerals. Between August 2022, when the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, and March 2023, major EV and battery makers announced investments totalling at least USD 52 billion in EV supply chains in North America.\nDespite a concentration of electric car sales and manufacturing in only a few big markets, there are promising signs in other regions. Electric car sales more than tripled in India and Indonesia last year, albeit from a low base, and they more than doubled in Thailand. The share of electric cars in total sales rose to 3% in Thailand, and to 1.5% in India and Indonesia. A combination of effective policies and private sector investment is likely to increase these shares in the future. In India, the government’s USD 3.2 billion incentive programme, which has attracted investments worth USD 8.3 billion, is expected to increasing battery manufacturing and EV rollout substantially in the coming years.\nIn emerging and developing economies, the most dynamic area of electric mobility is two- or three-wheel vehicles, which outnumber cars. For example, over half of India’s three-wheeler registrations in 2022 were electric, demonstrating their growing popularity. In many developing economies, two- or three-wheelers offer an affordable way to get access to mobility, meaning their electrification is important to support sustainable development.\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023\nExplore report\nRead the report\nThe Global EV Outlook is an annual publication that identifies and discusses recent developments in electric mobility across the globe.

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for two-thirds of new electric car registrations and two-thirds of the stock in 2020. China, with 4.5 million electric cars, has the largest fleet, though in 2020 Europe had the largest annual increase to reach 3.2 million.\nOverall the global market for all types of cars was significantly affected by the economic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first part of 2020 saw new car registrations drop about\none-third\nfrom the preceding year. This was partially offset by stronger activity in the second-half, resulting in a 16% drop overall year-on-year. Notably, with conventional and overall new car registrations falling, global electric car sales share rose 70% to a record 4.6% in 2020.\nAbout 3 million new electric cars were registered in 2020. For the first time, Europe led with 1.4 million new registrations. China followed with 1.2 million registrations and the United States registered 295 000 new electric cars.\nNumerous factors\ncontributed to increased electric car registrations in 2020. Notably, electric cars are gradually becoming more competitive in some countries on a total cost of ownership basis.\nSeveral governments provided or extended fiscal incentives\nthat buffered electric car purchases from the downturn in car markets.\nEurope\nOverall Europe’s car market contracted 22% in 2020. Yet, new electric car registrations more than doubled to 1.4 million representing a sales share of 10%. In the large markets, Germany registered 395 000 new electric cars and France registered 185 000.  The United Kingdom more than doubled registrations to reach 176 000. Electric cars in Norway reached a record high sales share of 75%, up about one-third from 2019. Sales shares of electric cars exceeded 50% in Iceland, 30% in Sweden and reached 25% in the Netherlands.\nThis surge in electric car registrations in Europe despite the economic slump reflect two policy measures. First, 2020 was the target year for the\nEuropean Union’s CO\n2\nemissions standards\nthat limit the average carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) emissions per kilometre driven for new cars. Second, many European\ngovernments increased subsidy schemes\nfor EVs as part of stimulus packages to counter the effects of the pandemic.\nIn European countries, BEV registrations accounted for 54% of electric car registrations in 2020, continuing to exceed those of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, the BEV registration level doubled from the previous year while the PHEV level thripled. The share of BEVs was particularly high in the Netherlands (82% of all electric car registrations), Norway (73%), United Kingdom (62%) and France (60%).\nChina\nThe overall car market in China was impacted by the panademic less than other regions. Total new car registrations were down about 9%.\nRegistration of new electric cars was lower than the overall car market in the first-half of 2020. This trend reversed in the second-half as China constrained the panademic. The result was a sales share of 5.7%, up from 4.8% in 2019. BEVs were about 80% of new electric cars registered.\nKey policy actions muted the incentives for the electric car market in China. Purchase subsidies were initially due to expire at the end of 2020, but following signals that they would be phased out more gradually prior to the pandemic, by April 2020 and in the midst of the pandemic, they were instead cut by 10% and exended through 2022. Reflecting economic concerns related to the pandemic,\nseveral cities relaxed car licence policies\n, allowing for more internal combustion engines vehicles to be registered to support local car industries.\nUnited States\nThe US car market declined 23% in 2020, though electric car registrations fell less than the overall market. In 2020, 295 000 new electric cars were registered, of which about 78% were BEVs, down from 327 000 in 2019. Their sales share nudged up to 2%. Federal incentives decreased in 2020 due to the federal tax credits for Tesla and General Motors, which account for the majority of electric car registrations,\nreaching their limit\n.\nOther countries\nElectric car markets in other countries\nwere resilent in 2020. For example, in Canada the new car market shrunk 21% while new electric car registrations were broadly unchanged from the previous year at 51 000.\nNew Zealand is a notable exception. In spite of its strong pandemic response, it saw a decline of 22% in new electric car registrations in 2020, in line with a car market decline of 21%. The decline seems to be largely related to exceptionally low EV registrations in April 2020 when New Zealand was in lockdown.\nAnother exception is Japan, where the overall new car market contracted 11% from the 2019 level while electric car registrations declined 25% in 2020. The electric car market in Japan has fallen in absolute and relative terms every year since 2017, when it peaked at 54 000 registrations and a 1% sales share. In 2020, there were 29 000 registrations and a 0.6% sales share.\nConsumer spending on EVs continues to rise, while government support stabilises\nConsumer spending\nConsumers spent USD 120 billion on electric car purchases in 2020, a 50% increase from 2019, which breaks down to a 41% increase in sales and a 6% rise in average prices. The rise in average prices reflects that Europe, where prices are higher on average than in Asia, accounted for a bigger proportion of new electric car registrations. In 2020, the global average BEV price was around USD 40 000 and around USD 50 000 for a PHEV.\nGovernment spending\nGovernments across the world spent USD 14 billion on direct purchase incentives and tax deductions for electric cars in 2020, a 25% rise year-on-year. Despite this, the share of government incentives in total spending on EVs has been on a downward slide from roughly 20% in 2015 to 10% in 2020.\nAll the increase in government spending was in Europe, where many\ncountries responded to the pandemic\n-induced economic downturn with incentive schemes that boosted electric car sales. In China, government spending decreased as the eligibility requirements for incentive programmes tightened.\nAn important novelty in subsidy schemes was the\nintroduction of price caps in Europe\nand China\n, i.e. no subsidy given for vehicles with prices above a certain threshold. This might be responsible for average electric car price falling in Europe and China: BEV cars sold in China were 3% cheaper in 2020 than in 2019, while PHEV cars in Europe were 8% cheaper.\nConsumer and government spending on electric cars, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nMore electric car models are available; ranges start to plateau\nElectric car models available globally and average range, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nElectric car models available by region, 2020\nOpen\nexpand\nAutomakers entice customers with a wide menu including electric SUV models\nWorldwide about 370 electric car models were available in 2020, a 40% increase from 2019. China has the widest offering, reflecting its  less consolidated automotive sector and that it is the world’s largest EV market. But in 2020 the biggest increase in number of models was in Europe where it  more than doubled.\nBEV models are offered in most vehicle segments in all regions; PHEVs are skewed towards larger vehicle segments. Sport utility vehicle (SUV) models account for half of the available electric car models in all markets. China has nearly twice as many electric car models available as the European Union, which has more than twice as many electric models as the United States. This difference can partially be explained by the comparatively lower maturity of the US EV market, reflecting its weaker regulations and incentives at the national level.\nThe average driving range of new BEVs has been steadily increasing. In 2020, the weighted average range for a new battery electric car was about 350 kilometres (km), up from 200 km in 2015.The weighted average range of electric cars in the United States tends to be higher than in China because of a bigger share of small urban electric cars in China.The average electric range of PHEVs has remained relatively constant about 50 km over the past few years.\nThe widest variety of models and the biggest expansion in 2020 was in the SUV segment. More than 55% of announced models worldwide are SUVs and pick-ups. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) may be moving to electrify this segment for the following reasons:\nSUVs are the fastest growing market segment in Europe and China, and by far the largest market share in the United States.\nSUVs command higher prices and generally offer higher profit margins than smaller vehicles. This means OEMs find it easier to bear the extra costs of electrification for SUVs since the powertrain accounts for a smaller share of the total cost compared with a small car.\nElectrifying the heaviest and most fuel consuming vehicles\ngoes further toward meeting emissions targets than electrifying a small car.\nIn Europe,\nthe ZLEV credit scheme in the most recent CO\n2\nemissions standards\noffers strong incentives for selling electric SUVs from 2025, as it relaxes emissions standards in proportion to their potential to reduce specific CO\n2\nemissions. In fact, in Europe, the share of electric SUV models is higher than for the overall market.\nChina leads in electric LCV sales with Europe not far behind and Korea entering the market\nGlobal electric light-commercial vehicle (LCV) stock numbers about 435 000 units. About a third of these are in Europe where new electric LCV registrations in 2020 were only 5% below those in China, which is the world leader.\nElectric LCV registrations in China in 2020 were 3 400 units below the previous year and slightly less than half of the peak in 2018. The bulk of the electric LCV registrations are BEVs, with PHEVs accounting for less than 10%.\nIn Europe, electric LCV registrations jumped almost 40% in 2020 from the prior year to exceed 37 000 units. Though that was less impressive than the more than doubling of electric car registrations. New EV registrations in Europe are being driven by economic stimulus packages and by\nCO\n2\nstandards\nthat limit emissions per kilometre driven. However, current standards for LCVs are not stringent enough to warrant large-scale electrification, as they do for passenger cars.\nRegistration of electric LCVs in 2020 in the rest of the world were about 19 000 units. Most of these were in Korea, reflecting the launch of two new BEV LCV models, but Canada also added to the stock of electric LCVs. Other markets around the world have yet to see much uptake of electric LCVs.\nThe explosion of home deliveries during the Covid-19 pandemic further boosted the electric LCV expansion in some countries. Increased deliveries raised concerns about\nair pollution\n, particularly in urban areas. In response, a number of companies announced\nplans to electrify delivery fleets\n.\nElectric LCVs registrations by region, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\n18 of the 20 largest OEMs have committed to increase the offer and sales of EVs\nOriginal equipment manufacturer announcements related to electric light-duty vehicles\nOpen\nexpand\nOriginal equipment manufacturer announcements related to electric light-duty vehicles\nClose dialog\nDownload image\nDownload image\nSources\nBMW (2021); BJEV-BAIC (2021); BYD (2021); Chery (2021); Changan Automobile (2021); Daimler (2021); Dongfeng (2021); FAW (2021); Ford (2021); GAC; General Motors; Honda (2021); Hyundai (2020); Mazda (2021); Renault-Nissan (2019); Maruti Suzuki (2019); SAIC (2021); Stellantis (2021); Toyota (2021); Volkswagen (2021).\nNotes\nThis table is based on the authors’ understanding of OEM announcements and may not be complete. It includes only announcements related to electric\nlight-duty vehicles (PHEVs and BEVs) and it excludes announcements related to hybrid vehicles and those that do not provide a clear indication of the EV share.\nManufacturers’ electrification targets align with the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario\nOEMs are expected to embrace electric mobility more widely in the 2020s. Notably 18 of the 20 largest OEMs (in terms of vehicles sold in 2020), which combined accounted for almost 90% of all worldwide new car registrations in 2020, have announced intentions to increase the number of available models and boost production of electric light-duty vehicles (LDVs).\nA number of manufacturers have raised the bar to go beyond\nprevious announcements\nrelated to EVs with an outlook beyond 2025. More than ten of the largest OEMs worldwide have declared electrification targets for 2030 and beyond.\nSignificantly, some OEMs plan to reconfigure their product lines to produce only electric vehicles. In the first-trimester of 2021 these announcements included:\nVolvo will only sell electric cars from 2030\n;\nFord will only electric car sales in Europe from 2030\n;\nGeneral Motors plans to offer only electric LDVs by 2035\n;\nVolkswagen aims for 70% electric car sales in Europe, and 50% in China and the United States by 2030\n;\nand Stellantis aims for 70% electric cars sales in Europe and 35% in the United States\n.\nOverall, the announcements by the OEMs translate to estimated cumulative sales of electric LDVs of 55-72 million by 2025. In the short term (2021-2022), the estimated cumulative sales align closely with the electric LDV\nprojections in the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario\n. By 2025, the estimated cumulative sales based on the OEMs announcements are aligned with the trajectories of IEA Sustainable Development Scenario.\nOEMs’ announcements compared to electric LDVs stock projections, 2021-2025\nOpen\nexpand\nTrends and developments in electric heavy-duty vehicles\nElectric bus and truck registrations expanded in major markets in 2020\nElectric bus and electric heavy-duty truck (HDT) registrations increased in 2020 in China, Europe and North America. The global electric bus stock was 600 000 in 2020 and the electric HDT stock was 31 000.\nBus registrations\nChina continues to dominate the\nelectric bus market\n, with registration of 78 000 new vehicles in 2020, up 9% on the year to reach a sales share of 27%. Local policies to curb air pollution are the driving force.\nElectric bus registrations in Europe were 2 100, an increase of around 7%, well below the doubling in registrations seen in 2019. Electric buses now make up 4% of all new bus registrations in Europe. It is too early to see the effect of the non-binding\nEuropean Clean Bus Deployment Initiative\nand demand may be still largely driven by muncipal level policies.\nIn North America, there were 580 new electric bus registrations in 2020, down almost 15% from the prior year. In the United States, electric bus deployment primarly reflects polices in California, which is the location of most of the current e-bus stock. In South America, Chile leads the way registering 400 electric buses in 2020 for a total stock of more than 800. India increased electric bus registrations 34% to 600 in 2020.\nHeavy-duty truck registrations\nGlobal electric HDT registrations were 7 400 in 2020, up 10% on the previous year. The global stock of electric HDTs numbers 31 000. China continues to dominate the category, with 6 700 new registrations in 2020, up 10% though much lower than the fourfold increase in 2019. Electric HDT registrations in Europe rose 23% to about 450 vehicles and in the United States increased to 240 vehicles. Electric trucks are still below 1% of sales in both.\nElectric\ntruck registrations by region, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nElectric bus registrations by region, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nElectric heavy-duty vehicle models are broadening\nThe availability of electric heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) models is expanding in leading global markets.\n1\nBuses were the earliest and most successful case of electrification in the HDV market, but the growing demand for electric trucks is pushing manufacturers to broaden product lines. Nevertheless, model availability is not the only indicator of a healthy market – fewer total models may reflect the reliability and broad applicability of existing designs, whereas more diversity of models may reflect the need to tailor products for specific needs and operations.\nThe growth in electric model availability from 2020 to 2023 across segments – bus, medium freight truck (MFT), heavy freight truck (HFT) and others – demonstrates manufacturers’ commitments to electrification. Truck makers such as\nDaimler\n,\nMAN\n,\nRenault\n,\nScania\nand\nVolvo\nhave indicated they see an all-electric future. The broadening range of available zero-emission HDVs, particularly in the HFT segment, demonstrates the commitment to provide fleets the flexibility to meet operational needs.\nThe HDV segment includes a wide variety of vehicle types, e.g. from long-haul freight to garbage collection trucks. China has the most variety in available electric bus models. The availablity of MFT models is broadest in the United States. For HFTs – the segment where the EV model offer is expected to the grow the most – Europe offers the widest selection of models.\nNumber of electric HDVs models available by segment and year, 2020-2023\nOpen\nexpand\nTypes of zero-emission HDVs expand, and driving range lengthens\nCurrent And Announced Zero Emission HDV Models By Segment, Release Year And Powertrain In Major Markets, 2020-2023\nOpen\nexpand\nCurrent And Announced Zero Emission HDV Models By Segment, Release Year And Powertrain In Major Markets, 2020-2023\nClose dialog\nDownload image\nDownload image\nSources\nIEA analysis based on the Global Drive to Zero ZETI tool.\nNotes\nData are derived from CALSTART’s Zero-Emission Technology Inventory.

This equates to 4.8 million vehicles switched to EVs and chargers installed in 6 500 locations by 2030.\nCollectively, by 2020 EV100 members had already deployed 169 000 zero-emission vehicles, double the previous year. Even though companies identify commercial vans and heavy-duty vehicles as the most difficult EVs to find, the number of commercial electric vehicles rose 23% in 2020, including a threefold increase in electric trucks.\nEV100 members are also expanding the availability of charging infrastructure for staff and customers, with 16 900 charging points installed at 2 100 locations worldwide. Over half of EV100 members are using renewables to power all their charging operations.\nSignificant barriers to EV adoption remain. EV100 members reported the lack of charging infrastructure as the top barrier (especially in the United States and United Kingdom). Lack of availability of appropriate vehicle types was also highlighted by the companies as a persistant obstacle. The purchase price of EVs remains an important hurdle despite many companies acknowledge the significant cost savings over the lifetime of a vehicle due to lower fuel and maintenance costs.\nTo help overcome these barriers, 71% of EV100 members support more favourable EV procurement tax benefits and 70% favour more supportive policies at state, regional and city government levels. Sixty percent of the member companies support government targets to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles.\nTop 5 barriers to EV adoption reported by EV100 member companies\nOpen\nexpand\nBattery demand lagged EV sales in 2020; Europe sees highest rise in demand\nAutomotive lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery production was 160 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2020, up 33% from 2019. The increase reflects a 41% increase in electric car registrations and a constant average battery capacity of 55 kilowatt-hours (kWh) for BEVs and 14 kWh for PHEVs. Battery demand for other transport modes increased 10%. Battery production continues to be dominated by China, which accounts for over 70% of global battery cell production capacity.\nChina accounted for the largest share of battery demand at almost 80 GWh in 2020, while Europe had the largest percentage increase at 110% to reach 52 GWh. Demand in the United States was stable at 19 GWh.\nNickel-manganese-cobalt continues to be the dominant chemistry for Li-ion batteries, with around 71% sales share and nickel-cobalt-aluminium accounting for most of the rest. Lithium-iron-phosphate battery chemistry has regained sales share but is still under 4% for the electric car market.\nAccording to the\nBNEF’s yearly survey of battery prices,\nthe weighted average cost of automotive batteries declined 13% in 2020 from 2019, reaching USD 137/kWh at a pack level. Lower prices are offered for high volume purchases, confirmed by\nteardown analysis\nof a VW ID3 showing an estimated cost of USD 100/kWh for its battery cells.\nIn Europe, demand for batteries in 2020 exceeded domestic production capacity. Today Europe’s main battery factories are located in Poland and Hungary. Production capacity is roughly 35 GWh per year, but\nannounced capacity could yield up to 400 GWh by 2025\n. Momentum was evident in 2020 in Europe with many new battery plants announced or under construction with support from the\nEuropean Investment Bank\n. In the United States, both Korean and domestic battery manufacturers have signalled large\ninvestments\nin a market currently dominated by a Tesla-Panasonic joint venture.\nBattery demand by region, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nBattery demand by mode, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nPandemic spreads popularity of electric micromobility\nElectric micromobility surged in the second-half of 2020, one of the consumer trends that accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic, further boosted by the construction of bike lanes and other measures to promote mobility.\nSales of private e-bikes in the United States more than doubled\nin 2020, outpacing sales of all bikes which were up an already healthy 65%.\nMany shared micromobility operators reduced or\nsuspended services\nduring the height of the second-quarter 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns. But as confinements were eased, services rebounded strongly, with\n270 cities worldwide relaunching operations\n. As of February 2021, around 650 cities have shared micromobility services. In Europe, e-scooter services have increased rapidly, with more than 100 cities adding operations since July 2020.\nPreliminary data from operators indicate\naverage trip distances on e-scooters have increased\nby around 25% relative to\nbefore the pandemic\n. Operators are increasingly offering more powerful e-bikes with plans to\nexpand into electric mopeds\n, which could further displace longer trips currently completed by car or public transit.\nSeveral major operators are introducing swappable batteries to improve operational efficiency and reduce emissions. Although the use of\nswappable batteries\nincreases the number of total batteries needed to support a fleet, it can significantly reduce operational emissions and enable longer lifetime of vehicles.\nPrivately owned electric two/three-wheelers (which include motorised vehicles such as motorcycles and mopeds but exclude micromobility solutions) are concentrated in Asia, with China accounting for 99% of registrations. The global stock of electric two/three-wheelers is now around 290 million. Electric two/three-wheelers account for one-third of all two/three-wheeler sales. While current sales are dominated by Asia, the market is growing rapidly in Europe, rising by 30% in 2020, benefitting from wider model availability and continued incentives.\nAvailability of dockless shared micromobility services in Europe and Central Asia, 2019-2021\nOpen\nexpand\nKorea takes a lead in deploying fuel cell electric vehicles\nFuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are zero-emission vehicles that convert hydrogen stored on-board using a fuel cell to power an electric motor. FCEV cars became commercially available in 2014, though registrations remain three orders of magnitude lower than EVs as hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) are not widely available and unlike EVs cannot be charged at home. Few commercial FCEV models are available and with high fuel cost and purchase prices result in a higher total cost of ownership than EVs.\nTo address the chicken-and-egg problem for FCEVs a number of goverments have funded the construction of HRS and have deployed public buses and trucks, such as garbage trucks, to provide a certain level of station utilisation. Today, there are approximately 540 HRS globally that provide fuel for almost 35 000 FCEVs. Approximately three-quarters of the FCEVs are LDVs, 15% are buses and 10% are trucks.\nIn 2020, Korea took the lead in FCEVs, surpassing the United States and China, to reach more than 10 000 vehicles. To support these FCEVs, the number of HRS in Korea increased by 50%, with 18 new stations in 2020. FCEVs in China are almost exclusively buses and trucks, unlike most other countries where cars are dominant. China accounts for 94% of global fuel cell buses and 99% of fuel cell trucks.\nIn 2020, the global FCEV stock increased 40%, with Korea contributing half and doubling its total FCEV stock. Japan and China increased the number of HRS, each opening about 25 stations in 2020. Worldwide the number of HRS increased 15%.\nFuel cell vehicles and hydrogen refueling station stock by region, 2020\nOpen\nexpand\nFuel cell electric vehicles stock by region and by mode, 2020\nOpen\nexpand\nDeployment of vehicle-charging infrastructure\nPublicly accessible slow and fast chargers increased to 1.3 million in 2020\nStock of slow public electric light duty vehicles chargers, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nStock of fast public electric light duty vehicles chargers, 2015-2020\nOpen\nexpand\nInstallation of publicly accessible chargers expanded sevenfold in the last five years; Covid-19 muted the pace in 2020 while China still leads\nWhile most charging of EVs is done at home and work, roll-out of publicly accessible charging will be critical as countries leading in EV deployment enter a stage where simpler and improved autonomy will be demanded by EV owners. Publicly accessible chargers reached 1.3 million units in 2020, of which 30% are fast chargers. Installation of publicly accessible chargers was up 45%, a slower pace than the 85% in 2019, likely because work was interrupted in key markets due to the pandemic. China leads the world in availability of both slow and fast publicly accessible chargers.\nSlow chargers\nThe pace of slow charger (charging power below 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 65% to about 500 000 publicly accessible slow chargers. This represents more than half of the world’s stock of slow chargers.\nEurope is second with around 250 000 slow chargers, with installtions increasing one-third in 2020. The Netherlands leads in Europe with more than 63 000 slow chargers. Sweden, Finland and Iceland doubled their stock of slow chargers in 2020.\nInstallation of slow chargers in the United States increased 28% in 2020 from the prior year to total 82 000. The number of slow chargers installed in Korea rose 45% in 2020 to 54 000, putting it in second place.\nFast chargers\nThe pace of fast charger (charging power more than 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 44% to almost 310 000 fast chargers, slower than the 93% pace of annual growth in 2019. The relatively high number of publically available fast chargers in China is to compensate for a paucity of private charging options and to facilitate achievement of goals for rapid EV deployment.\nIn Europe, fast chargers are being rolled out at a higher rate than slow ones. There are now more than 38 000 public fast chargers, up 55% in 2020, including nearly 7 500 in Germany, 6 200 in the United Kingdom, 4 000 in France and 2 000 in the Netherlands. The United States counts 17 000 fast chargers, of which nearly 60% are Tesla superchargers. Korea has 9 800 fast chargers.\nPublicly accessible fast chargers facilitate longer journeys. As they are increasingly deployed, they will enable longer trips and encourage late adopters without access to private charging to purchase an electric vehicle.\nMost countries in Europe did not achieve 2020 AFID targets for publicly accessible chargers\nEuropean countries for the most part failed to meet the recommended electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) per EV 2020 targets for publicly accessible chargers set by the\nAlternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive\n(AFID). However, there are wide disparities between countries.\nAFID, the key policy regulating the deployment of public electric EVSE in the European Union, recommended that member states aim for 1 public charger per 10 EVs, a ratio of 0.1 in 2020.\nIn the European Union, the average public EVSE per EV ratio was 0.09 at the end of 2020. But that is not the whole story. The Netherlands and Italy are above the target at 0.22 and 0.13 respectively, with almost all being slow chargers, though fast chargers are 3% of the installations in the Netherlands and 9% in Italy.\nCountries with the highest EV penetration tend to have the lowest EVSE per EV ratios, such as Norway (0.03), Iceland (0.03) and Denmark (0.05). In these sparsely populated countries with many detached houses and private parking spaces, most EV owners can\nlargely use private home charging\n. To a lesser extent, it also refects that the Nordic countries have a higher proportion of fast chargers, with shares of 40% in Iceland, 31% in Norway and 17% in Denmark.\nRatio of public chargers per EV stock by country, 2020\nOpen\nexpand\nPlanning needs to start now for megachargers to enable long-distance trucking\nThe roll-out of public charging infrastructure has so far mostly focused on serving electric light-duty vehicles. The electrification of heavy freight trucks (HFTs) is a longer term endeavour, with less than 40 electric HFTs on the road in 2020.\nHFTs require batteries with high capacity to meet their needs for heavy-duty cycles and long-range operations, and consequently they require high power charging. So far charging options for HFTs have tended to be early stage demonstrations, proof-of-concept activities and efforts to faciliate\nstandardisation\n.\nMegachargers of 1 megawatt (MW) or more would be capable of charging trucks operating over long distances reasonably quickly. Long-term planning for megacharger infastructure is needed now to avoid negative impacts on the electrical grid. Some impact to grids is inevitable given the\nhigh power requirements\nof megachargers. Significant investment may be needed for grid reinforcements, modernisation, storage and integration with power systems. Planning and co-ordination among electricity generators, distribution system operators and megacharging operations are needed.\nSome efforts are underway to develop standards for megachargers. Working jointly, the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council have developed an\nultra-high power charging standard\n(up to 900 kW), called ChaoJi. A version up to 1.8 MW, called Ultra ChaoJi, is under development. In parallel, the CharIN initiative\nestablished a task force\ncalled the Megawatt Charging System Taskforce which aims to develop a new high power standard above 1 MW by 2023 for charging heavy-duty trucks, based on the\ncombined charging system (CCS) standard\n. Prototype testing started in\nSeptember 2020\n. Tesla\nannounced in late 2020\nthat it is working with third-parties to develop a standard for megachargers that can be provided to Semi truck owners. Tesla is one of five to have submitted a design to CharIN.\nIndustry experts addressing international standardisation are evaluating avenues to harmonise megacharger standards for mutual compatibility, in order to facilitate the roll-out of electric HFTs.\nThere are also regional efforts to develop megacharging infrastructure. Underpinned with\nstimulus funding\n, Iberdrola, a Spanish multinational electric utility, has expressed interest in installing megacharger infrastructure in heavy-duty freight truck corridors in Spain by 2025. ElaadNL (EV knowledge centre of Dutch grid operators), along with local and national government entities, in September 2021 launched an\nopen-access test centre for companies and academia\nthat offers test facilities for megachargers. In the United States, the\nWest Coast Clean Transit Corridor Initiative\naims to install charging sites capable of charging HDTs at 2 MW along key transit corridors from Mexico to the boder with Canada by 2030.\nReferences\nElectric HDVs data are derived from the Global Drive to Zero’s\nZero Emission Technology Inventory\n(ZETI) which is a regularly updated tool that offers a detailed glimpse of announced OEM production model timelines.

The year 2026 has emerged as a tipping point for an acceleration in EV adoption that will drive automotive electrification trends ahead. By 2030 over one in four new passenger cars sold will be an electric vehicle. Many major vehicle manufacturers worldwide have signaled the end of an era of internal combustion engines (ICE) as the transition to zero emission vehicles (ZEV) is ramped up.\nThe top automakers are expected to account for more than 70% of global EV production by the year 2030 (compared to 2022 when they represented only 10% of all EV manufacturers). But despite the rapidly growing choices EV consumers have, and the unprecedented loyalty rates among EV return buyers, the industry as a whole still needs to tackle consumers range anxiety, particular for those without a garage or those traveling long distances.\nThe solution needs to be a joint effort between multiple industries: automotive, utilities, government, and private property owners such as shopping malls and apartment complexes. As these paths converge, vehicle electrification trends will increase exponentially. And we may, indeed, see the end of the ICE-age.\nTalk to a S&P Global Mobility representative about our powertrain and sustainable mobility solutions\nLEARN MORE >\nHow many vehicles sold last month?\nS&P Global Mobility provides near real-time updates of electrified (BEV and hybrid) light vehicle sales volumes for 150+ countries by brand, model and fuel type.

This has led to a decrease in the cost of electric vehicles as EV batteries are one of the most expensive components of an electric vehicle. The prices of EV batteries fell significantly in the last decade, from USD 1,200/kWh in 2010 to USD 160/kWh in 2023 and is expected to decrease in the coming years. Meanwhile the price is as low as USD 100 per kWh in China. This is because of the reducing manufacturing costs of these batteries, reduced cathode material prices, higher production, etc. The prices of EV batteries are expected to fall to approximately USD 60 per kWh by 2030, which is expected to significantly reduce the prices of EVs, making them cheaper than conventional ICE vehicles. The price of EV batteries is expected to reach around USD 80 per kWh by 2025. This will bring the price of EVs to the same level as that of ICE vehicles in the market and start a big shift to EVs. From 2025, we can expect EVs to get cheaper than some ICE vehicles. The improvement in battery technology is the main reason for this fall in battery prices. Once Solid-State Batteries enter the EV market, we can expect another price fall (per kWh) by the end of this decade.\nRestraint: High initial investments for installing EV fast charging infrastructure\nThe initial investment in setting up a fast-charging system is significantly higher compared to petrol, CNG, or LPG fuel stations. This has been a major restraint for countries around the world in adopting EVs on a higher scale during the past decade. Technological enhancements are expected to negate this restraint, leading to decreasing costs. The cost for EV fast charging is high due to the higher equipment costs and the requirement for an additional fast charger to install a transformer to connect the grid and charging system. This has led to the slower development of charging networks around the world which have gained traction during the past few years due to vehicle emission concerns.  The high initial investment required for EV infrastructure is one of the key factors influencing EV sales. Setting up a comprehensive and efficient EV charging station can incur significant costs. For instance, in India, a single DC fast charger setup could cost more than USD 12,193, and if multiple chargers are installed, the initial investment could easily go up to USD 48,772, taking into account the cost/rent of the land. The type of chargers installed also impacts the investment, with different charger types having varying costs.  In APAC region for instance prices vary by charger type and have additional costs. These include additional expenses such as that for obtaining a new electricity connection, civil works, EVSE management software and integration (approximately USD 9,145), and technicians, manpower, and maintenance (around USD 4,267 yearly). Advertising and promotion costs (about USD 609) and land lease expenses (around USD 7,316 yearly if the land is leased) further add to the total. Consequently, the total approximate cost for the first year, including setup and leased land, could reach USD 487,72. Subsequent operational costs, starting from the second year, amount to USD 12,193 annually, including land lease expenses. Operational costs include software maintenance, technical maintenance, and manpower expenses, all contributing to the significant investment required for establishing and running an EV charging station. These high initial and operational costs create barriers for businesses and individuals looking to invest in EV infrastructure, which in turn can impact the growth and adoption of EVs in the market. Nevertheless, as the demand for EVs rises and technology improves, we can expect to see potential reductions in these costs over time.\nOpportunity: Rising demand for electric vehicles in the automotive and transportation sectors\nIncrease in the adoption and demand for electric vehicles has accentuated the need to develop charging infrastructure and the EV market. Leading markets for electric vehicles such as China, US, and Germany are investing significantly in electric vehicles and EV charging infrastructure along with research & development for faster and efficient charging methods, longer range EVs, and lower cost batteries. Significant investments by automakers are expected to cater to the rising demand for EVs. Countries across North America and Europe along with many Asian countries have adopted measures to reduce emissions during the coming decades and replace their vehicle fleets for lower emissions by varying numbers by 2035. This is expected to lead to a significantly high demand for electric vehicles. OEMs offer a wide range of vehicles, from small hatchbacks such as Leaf to high-end sedans such as Tesla model 3. The wide range of product offerings has attracted a high number of consumers, resulting in an increased market for electric vehicles. For instance, in January 2018, Ford announced plans to increase planned investments to USD 11 billion by end of 2022 for the development of EVs. The company introduced 40 EVs in 2022, of which 16 are expected to be fully electric and 24 are expected to be plug-in hybrid vehicles. The investment is higher than the previously announced target of USD 4.5 billion. Further, Stellantis also plans to come with 29 new EVs by 2030. Launched in September 2020, SAIC-GM-Wuling has a range of 106 miles on a single charge and was one of the highest selling EVs in 2021 and 2022.\nChallenge: High cost of electric vehicles (compared to ICE)\nThe high manufacturing cost of EVs has been a major concern in their widespread adoption. The expected reduction in battery prices and reduced R&D costs are expected to lead to the reduction in the overall cost of purchasing electric hatchbacks, crossovers, or SUVs to reach the levels of ICE vehicles, leading to the rising demand for EVs. The cost of EVs is significantly high compared to that of ICE vehicles due to the high price of rechargeable lithium ion batteries required for these vehicles. The price of the cathode affects the price of the batteries to a high extent. This is because materials such as cobalt, nickel, lithium, and magnesium used in these batteries is high-priced. The cost of the production of EVs is also significantly high compared to ICE vehicles due to the expensive process involved in developing these vehicles. The cost of the development of higher range EVs is significantly higher due to the requirement of higher specification batteries, advanced technology used for production, and highly expensive components used in the vehicles.\nMarket Ecosystem\nFCEVs to be the fastest growing segment during forecast period\nThe FCEV uses fuel cells to generate electricity for powering the vehicle. Fuel cells in a vehicle generate electricity from the oxygen in the air and compressed hydrogen. FCEVs are completely emission-free as they emit water or heat. FCEVs have been introduced in the US, majorly in California. Many renowned truck manufacturers have already developed fuel-cell electric trucks. For instance, in September 2022, Toyota Motor Corporation (Japan) and Kenworth (US) designed heavy-duty Class 8 FCEVs. Similarly, in January 2023, Adani Group (India) signed an agreement with Ashok Leyland (India) and Ballard Power (Canada) to launch a pilot project for a hydrogen fuel cell electric truck in India Japan and Europe are focusing on the launch of FCEVs. Top FCEVs on the road that are commercially available include Hyundai Tucson FCEV, Toyota Mirai, Hyundai Nexo, and Honda Clarity. Fuel cell vehicles have higher fuel economy and can travel approximately 300–400 miles with a full fuel tank. The best FCEVs can have a range of more than 500 miles on a single filling. The refueling time for fuel cell-powered vehicles is approximately three to five minutes. This makes FCEVs an ideal option for transportation on definite or fixed routes. However, the availability of infrastructure such as hydrogen refueling stations and hydrogen production facilities supporting fuel cell technology is very limited worldwide due to the high cost of the fuel cell stack and system. Hydrogen is also difficult to store and transport which adds to the cost of the system. However, governments of various regions are increasingly investing in the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure. For instance, in November 2022, the Government of Alberta in Canada announced an investment of USD 300 million from the Strategic Innovation Fund's Net Zero Accelerator initiative, along with a provincial contribution of USD 161.5 million, to back a substantial USD 1.6 billion project led by Air Products Canada Ltd. The project aims to drive the advancement of clean fuels and clean energy in Canada while creating numerous middle-class job opportunities. The funding will specifically support the construction of a hydrogen production and liquefaction facility in Edmonton. The facility will utilize auto thermal reforming and carbon capture technology, further emphasizing the commitment to sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions.\nMid-priced EV segment to be the largest market during the forecast period\nA mid-priced vehicle is considered to have a price of USD 30,000 to USD 45,000. This vehicle class has limited features with low emphasis on features such as infotainment, instrument cluster, and other expensive features. China is one of the leading markets for the mid-priced segment. Established automotive manufactures such as Hyundai, General Motors, Honda, and Nissan are also manufacturing mid-priced EVs to acquire higher market shares. Some other mid-priced EVs include BMW 3 Series PHEV, Zeekr One, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Volvo XC40, Renault Megane EV, Hyundai  Ioniq 5, Volkswagen  ID 4, Kia  Niro EV, etc. In 2022, BYD Song Pro/Plus was the best selling mid-priced EV in Asia Pacific region, followed by Tesla Model 3 in Europe and North America. The EV Market forecast for the mid-priced segment is the largest in the Asia Pacific and European regions due to the demand for low-emission vehicles at reasonable prices. Various top EV models such as Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe, Mitsubishi Outlander, Volkswagen Passat, Hyundai Kona, etc. fall under this category. These were also some of the largest selling EVs in these regions excluding Tesla in 2022. Thus, the demand for mid-priced EVs has been high in the past few years and is expected to keep rising in the coming decade. The market in the MEA is expected to grow at the highest rate in this segment as there is expected to be rising new demand in this region for these vehicles in the next decade.\nAsia Pacific to be the largest and the fastest growing market by value during the forecast period\nThe region is home to some of the fastest-developing economies, such as China and India. The governments of these emerging economies have recognized the growth potential of the EV Market trends and, hence, have taken different initiatives to attract major OEMs to manufacture electric vehicles in domestic markets. The region is home to 93 of the world’s most polluted cities, and has a high energy demand. As of 2022, transportation sector in the region accounts for around 14% of overall emissions. Thus, countries in the region, are planning to reduce emissions in the coming years. China, the e-mobility leader in the region, had set a target of over 20% EV sales by 2025, which it had already achieved in 2022 and is expected to have around 35% in 2023. Similarly, countries such as South Korea, Japan and India have also announced plans to shift to EVs in coming years. India for instance, plans to have 30% of its passenger car sales to be electric by 2030. South Korea and Japan are also aiming to be among the world’s top 5 EV producers by 2030. China is also investing significantly in the production of both electric passenger as well as commercial vehicles, with plans for export. OEMs such as BYD plan to open plants in other parts of the world to manufacture electric buses and electric trucks to meet regional demand. The country supports EV usage by offering a subsidy for buying EVs. The country is also encouraging manufacturers to develop better EV technology. Various EV charging stations are set up across the country due to the subsidy for setting up EV infrastructure. The country has promoted the development and use of EV buses and trucks. In 2020, a low-cost EV passenger car, Wulin Hongguang Mini EV, was developed in China, costing less than USD 5,000. The vehicle sold majorly in the domestic market, but its gross sales were the second highest of the total EV sales in 2022. The demand of Mini-EVs has been growing in the country, with more choices available with other leading Chinese manufacturers entering the mini-EV space.

DISCUSSION GUIDE\n19.3 KNOWLEDGESTORE: MARKETSANDMARKETS’  SUBSCRIPTION PORTAL\n19.4 CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS\n19.5 RELATED REPORTS\n19.6 AUTHOR DETAILS\nThe study involved four major activities in estimating the current size of the electric vehicle market. Exhaustive secondary research was done to collect information on the market, the peer market, and the child markets. The next step was to validate these findings, assumptions, and sizing with the industry experts across value chains through primary research. The top-down and bottom-up approaches were employed to estimate the complete market size. Thereafter, market breakdown and data triangulation processes were used to estimate the market size of segments and subsegments.\nSecondary Research\nIn the secondary research process, various secondary sources such as company annual reports/presentations, press releases, industry association publications [for example, publications of electric vehicle manufacturers, International Energy Agency (IEA), Alternative Fuel Data Center (AFDC), European Alternate Fuels Observatory (EAFO), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Regional Transportation Authority (RTA), country-level vehicle associations and trade organizations, and the US Department of Transportation (DOT)], EV related magazine articles, directories, technical handbooks, World Economic Outlook, trade websites, government organizations websites, and technical articles have been used to identify and collect information useful for an extensive commercial study of the global EV Market.\nPrimary Research\nExtensive primary research has been conducted after acquiring an understanding of this market scenario through secondary research. Several primary interviews have been conducted with market experts from the demand- and supply-side OEMs (in terms of component supply, country-level government associations, and trade associations) and component manufacturers across four major regions, namely, Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, Middle East & Africa. Approximately 23% and 77% of primary interviews have been conducted from the demand and supply side, respectively. Primary data has been collected through questionnaires, emails, LinkedIn, and telephonic interviews. In the canvassing of primaries, we have strived to cover various departments within organizations, such as sales, operations, and administration, to provide a holistic viewpoint in our electric vehicle market report.\nAfter interacting with industry experts, we conducted brief sessions with highly experienced independent consultants to reinforce the findings from our primaries. This, along with the in-house subject matter experts’ opinions, has led us to the findings as described in the remainder of this report. Following is the breakdown of primary respondents.\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study,\ndownload the pdf brochure\nMarket Size Estimation\nThe bottom-up approach was used to estimate and validate the total market size. This method was also used extensively to estimate the size of various subsegments in the market. The research methodology used to estimate the market size includes the following:\nThe key players in the industry and markets have been identified through extensive secondary research\nThe industry’s supply chain and market size, in terms of volume, have been determined through primary and secondary research processes\nAll percentage shares, splits, and breakdowns have been determined using secondary sources and verified through primary sources\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study,\nRequest for Free Sample Report\nMarket Size Validation\nThe top-down approach has been used to estimate and validate the size of the electric vehicle market by drive type and top speed in terms of volume.\nThe top-down approach has been used to estimate and validate the size of the EV Market. In this approach, key drive and top speeds of electric vehicles are identified for each propulsion type (BEV, PHEV, and FCEV) at the country-level. The penetration of each identified drive type and top speed type for each propulsion type is multiplied with the volume of each vehicle at the country-level to derive the total volume. All country-level data is summed up to derive the global market by drive and top speed type.\nData Triangulation\nAfter arriving at the overall market size—using the market size estimation processes as explained above—the market was split into several segments and subsegments. To complete the overall market engineering process and arrive at the exact statistics of each market segment and subsegment, data triangulation, and market breakdown procedures were employed, wherever applicable. The data was triangulated by studying various factors and trends from both the demand and supply sides.\nMarket Definition\nAn electric vehicle is an automobile propelled by one or more electric motors.

It will feature the market’s first true steer-by-wire platform, which, along with a composite leaf spring suspension, enables the skateboard’s flat structure and maximizes vehicle interior space. Canoo has also developed proprietary electric drivetrain and battery systems which are incorporated into the skateboard. All of Canoo’s EVs will share the same skateboard and utilize different cabins or “top hats” that can be paired on top to create unique vehicles. This highly modular approach will facilitate efficient production at scale and enable Canoo to rapidly develop vehicles serving different market and consumer segments at reduced cost, as the majority of research and development and crash testing is built into the skateboard.\nCanoo Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Ulrich Kranz said, “Today marks an important milestone of Canoo’s effort to reinvent the development, production and go-to-market model of the electric vehicle industry. Our technology allows for rapid and cost-effective vehicle development through the world’s flattest skateboard architecture, and we believe our subscription model will transform the consumer ownership experience. We are excited to partner with Hennessy Capital and we are energized to begin our journey through a shared passion to deliver an environmentally friendly and versatile vehicle development platform to the market.”\nDaniel Hennessy, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of HCAC said, “We are thrilled to partner with Canoo on their mission to reinvent urban mobility with a greener, simpler and more affordable portfolio of EV solutions. Unlike any other EV company, Canoo has created a go-to-market strategy that captures both B2C and B2B demand with the same skateboard architecture and technology that has already been validated by key partnerships such as with Hyundai. HCAC has an abiding commitment to sustainable technologies and infrastructure, and we are excited to serve as a catalyst to advance the launch of the Canoo vehicle offerings.”\nLed by Kranz, an automotive industry veteran with more than 30 years of executive experience at BMW, together with nearly 300 employees, the Canoo team has already shown its ability to deliver results by successfully designing, engineering and manufacturing its Beta vehicle in just 19 months and has completed more than 50 physical crash tests. Canoo expects to introduce its first model in 2022 that will be targeted at consumers in major urban markets. This lifestyle vehicle – eponymously named the canoo – leverages the company’s low profile skateboard architecture to deliver the highest volume utilization across all classes of competitor vehicles currently on the market and has been purposefully developed for a subscription business model.\nIn addition, Canoo has designed a commercial delivery B2B vehicle with expected availability in 2023 that directly capitalizes on Canoo’s core skateboard technology. Canoo’s delivery vehicle competes in a size segment that other competitors are currently not addressing and capitalizes on the need for a small, city- built, last-mile delivery solution. This high-efficiency platform maximizes cubic cargo volume and targets the fast growing last-mile delivery market.\nCanoo’s consumer go-to-market strategy capitalizes on changing consumer preferences to deliver a month-to-month, commitment-free, subscription-based business model. With a single monthly fee and no upfront payment, Canoo members enjoy the benefits of an all-inclusive experience that, in addition to your own canoo vehicle, includes maintenance, warranty, registration and access to insurance and vehicle charging. This go-to-market model is designed to deliver an affordable and simplified customer experience while also enhancing lifetime vehicle revenue and margin to shareholders.\nTo learn more about Canoo and for a video of the company’s vehicle, please\nclick here\n.\nTransaction Overview\nThe business combination values Canoo at an implied $2.4 billion pro forma equity value, at the $10.00 per share price and assuming no redemptions of HCAC’s existing public stockholders. The combined company will receive approximately $600 million of proceeds from an upsized fully committed common stock PIPE offering of over $300 million, along with the approximately $300 million cash held in trust assuming no redemptions of HCAC’s existing public stockholders. The boards of directors of both Canoo and HCAC have unanimously approved the proposed business combination, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020, subject to, among other things, the approval by HCAC stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions.\nAdditional information about the proposed transaction, including a copy of the merger agreement and investor presentation, will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by HCAC today with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at\nwww.sec.gov\n.\nAdvisors\nBofA Securities is serving as exclusive financial advisor, and Cooley LLP is serving as legal advisor to Canoo.

Starting today, the lifestyle vehicle, MPDV and pickup truck can be reserved in the United States, with a $100 deposit per vehicle at\nwww.canoo.com/reservations\n. The Lifestyle Vehicle will be the first vehicle to market in 2022, and has targeted pricing starting from $34,750 -$49,950\ni\nfor Delivery, Base and Premium models, before incentives, or optional equipment. Deliveries for the Pickup Truck and scaled production for MPDV are scheduled to begin as early as 2023.\n\"It's no longer a question of whether America will go EV – but when. Our line-up is future-forward and succeeds where others have struggled: Giving people the EV that works smarter for them at a price that can work for their budgets. That's why we are designing for flexible use cases and focused on productivity solutions,\" said Tony Aquila, Chairman & CEO Canoo Inc. \"We are designing for people who work hard, play hard and need something reliable, that will last and give you value. We're for the 99% not the 1%. Our vehicle line-up is built for the backbone of America – to give you value so you can work smarter.\"\nLifestyle Vehicle – The Flex-Vehicle for Everybody\nCanoo designed the Lifestyle Vehicle to be cabin forward to maximize interior space and function, with exportable power and customization options – all on a small footprint. Now available in four trims: Base, Premium, Adventure and Delivery – the Lifestyle Vehicle is the ultimate multi-tasker. Without the need for an engine compartment, the Lifestyle Vehicle features Canoo's unique street view window for improved driver visibility. Our Adventure trim has more ground clearance and a more muscular profile. The bumpers have been enhanced and a metal skid plate was added for increased vehicle durability. And Canoo's signature headlights and taillights serve as core brand identifiers without the need for a logo.\nLike all Canoo vehicles, the Lifestyle Vehicle is a purpose-built EV based on the company's proprietary and highly versatile multi-purpose platform architecture. The Lifestyle Vehicle has the interior space of a large SUV, with the exterior footprint of a compact car and is made for urban, adventure, families, fleet, ride hailing and more.\nAnticipated specifications include up to 300hp and 332 lb.-ft. of peak motor torque with 250 miles of battery range.

Range topping Adventure trim pricing will be announced in the coming months.\nThe Pickup Truck - Ready for Work & Weekend\nCanoo's fully electric pickup truck is all-American and ready for work and the weekend. Featuring a cabin-forward design, steer-by-wire technology and proprietary multi-purpose platform architecture, the pickup truck has an extendable flatbed that competes with America's best-selling pickup trucks on a smaller footprint—making it easier to maneuver and more convenient to drive. The pickup truck was built to work for users and features accessories that accommodate on-site jobs, including exportable power, advanced exterior lighting, fold down worktable and cargo storage, flip-down side-tables, sidestep and storage, extendable bed with space dividers and multi-accessory charge port.\nSpecifications include dual or rear motor configurations, with 500+hp and 550 lb.-ft. of torque with dual motors, vehicle payload capacity of 1800 lbs. and 200+ miles of battery range.\nThe Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle (MPDV) - Small Business, Fleet & Family Friendly\nOur delivery vehicle is designed to maximize return on investment for a wide range of commercial customers. It was built with small businesses, fleets and last-mile delivery companies in mind. High efficiency and class leading cargo volumes offer cost savings which allow businesses to reinvest and thrive – making this delivery vehicle a great option for independent contractors, tradespeople, utilities, service technicians and more.\nBi-directional onboard charging maximizes functionality and transforms the vehicle into a power plant for equipment and tools that can be powered up even at remote destinations. The vehicle design also accommodates workstations to store and access a variety of devices, products and equipment.\nDepending on the configuration, anticipated specifications include up to 200hp and 236 lb.-ft. of peak motor torque with up to 250 miles of battery range.\n* Targeted price ranges reflect current estimates and are subject to change.

Read\nInnovation\nCopy link to clipboard\nBENTONVILLE, Ark., July 12, 2022\n— Walmart (NYSE: WMT) has signed a definitive agreement with Canoo (NASDAQ: GOEV), a high-tech advanced mobility company, to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (LDV), with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. The vehicles will be used to deliver online orders in a sustainable way which will also contribute to Walmart’s goal to achieve zero-emissions by 2040. While the LDV is expected to begin hitting the road in 2023, the companies plan to kick off advanced deliveries to refine and finalize vehicle configuration in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in the coming weeks.\nThe LDV: Engineered for sustainable last mile deliveries with improved driver ergonomics and safety\nCanoo’s fully electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (LDV) is an all-American commercial EV optimized for sustainable last mile delivery use cases. As with all Canoo vehicles, the LDV is built on a proprietary multi-purpose platform (MPP) architecture that integrates the motors, battery module and other critical driving components. The LDV has a last mile delivery optimized cabin and customized cargo space. Canoo is utilizing true steer by wire technology, reducing moving parts and cabin intrusion, resulting in more usable interior space, better driver ergonomics and the addition of a panoramic window to improve road visibility.\nThe LDV is engineered for high frequency stop-and-go deliveries and speedy vehicle to door drop-off, including grocery and food/meal delivery. Its customized interior is designed for small package delivery, at competitive per stop economics. The modular design and 120 cubic feet cargo volume are adaptable to evolve with customer needs which contributes to a decreasing per unit investment over time.\n“We are proud to have been selected by Walmart, one of the most sophisticated buyers in the world, to provide our high-tech, all-electric, American made Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle to add to their impressive logistics capabilities. Our LDV has the turning radius of a small passenger vehicle on a parking friendly, compact footprint, yet the payload and cargo space of a commercial delivery vehicle. This is the winning algorithm to seriously compete in the last mile delivery race, globally,” said Tony Aquila, investor, chairman and CEO of Canoo. “Walmart’s massive store footprint provides a strategic advantage in today’s growing ‘Need it now’ mindset and an unmatched opportunity for growing EV demand, especially at today’s gas prices.”\nExpanding Walmart’s last mile delivery fleet\nCanoo’s electric vehicles will be driven by Walmart associates and used to deliver online orders, from groceries to general merchandise, as well as the potential to be used for\nWalmart GoLocal,\nthe retailer’s delivery-as-a-service business.\n“We’re thrilled to continue diversifying our last mile delivery fleet with Canoo’s unique and sustainably focused all-electric technology which will provide our associates with safe, ergonomic delivery vehicles,” said David Guggina, senior vice president of innovation and automation, Walmart U.S. “Today, the closest Walmart to customers is right in their pockets – it’s the Walmart app. By continuing to expand our last mile delivery fleet in a sustainable way, we’re able to provide customers and Walmart+ members with even more access to same-day deliveries while keeping costs low.”\nIn addition to dedicated fulfillment centers, Walmart uses 3,800 of its stores, which are located within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population, to fulfill online orders. The retailer does this using a combination of Walmart associates, independent contractors driving on the Spark Driver Network, third-party delivery service providers, and in some locations, autonomous vehicles and drones, to make deliveries. Through their expansive last mile delivery network, Walmart can reach 80% of the U.S. population with same-day delivery on a growing assortment of items.\nCollaborating close to home\nCanoo’s agreement with Walmart builds on the company’s existing commitments in the state of Arkansas. Last year Canoo announced it had selected Bentonville, Arkansas, as its headquarters and Pryor, Oklahoma, as the site for its U.S. manufacturing, further establishing an EV ecosystem in the heartland to create thousands of technology and manufacturing jobs in the surrounding communities.\n“We’re encouraged that by being located in close proximity to the Canoo headquarters, we have the advantage to collaborate and innovate in real-time as well as the opportunity to aid in the creation of manufacturing and technology jobs here in our home state of Arkansas,” added Guggina.\nCanoo anticipates starting production of the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles beginning in Q4, 2022.\nAbout Walmart\nWalmart Inc.
